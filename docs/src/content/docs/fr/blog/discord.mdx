  alt: A retro 8-bit style illustration featuring two overlapping speech bubbles
    representing communication. Below them is a simple, pixelated monitor
    displaying symbols like gears, folder icons, and branching connection lines
    to suggest scripts, projects, and networks. The design is geometric, flat,
    and minimal, rendered with a 5-color corporate palette, focusing purely on
    clean, blocky visuals without any human figures or text.
