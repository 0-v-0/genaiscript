In this blog post, we'll dive into how you can use GenAIScript to efficiently process and transform JSON data. This is particularly useful for tasks such as data migration, API data manipulation, or automating data workflows. We'll go through a practical example that demonstrates common JSON operations leveraging the capabilities of GenAIScript.

### 🛠️ Setting Up Our Transformation Function

First, let's define a transformation function called `transformJSON`. This function takes an input JSON object and returns a new object with transformed data.

```javascript
function transformJSON(inputJSON) {
  return {
    newData: inputJSON.map(item => ({
      id: item.id,
      value: item.value * 2 // Example transformation: double the value
    }))
  };
}
```

Here's what each part of this function does:
- **`inputJSON.map(item => ...)`**: We use the `map` method to iterate over each item in the input JSON array. `map` creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.
- **`id: item.id`**: For each item, we retain the original `id`.
- **`value: item.value * 2`**: We transform the `value` field by multiplying it by 2. This is a simple transformation intended to demonstrate how you can manipulate data.

### 🚀 Executing Our Script

To see our transformation function in action, we'll set up a main execution block that uses this function.

```javascript
// Main script execution
main(async () => {
  const rawData = '[{"id": 1, "value": 10}, {"id": 2, "value": 20}]';
  const jsonData = JSON.parse(rawData);
  const transformedData = transformJSON(jsonData);
  console.log('Transformed Data:', JSON.stringify(transformedData));
});
```

- **`const rawData = ...`**: We start by defining a string that represents an array of JSON objects. This is our sample data.
- **`const jsonData = JSON.parse(rawData);`**: We parse the JSON string into an actual JavaScript object using `JSON.parse()`, so we can work with it in our script.
- **`const transformedData = transformJSON(jsonData);`**: We apply our `transformJSON` function to the parsed data.
- **`console.log(...);`**: Finally, we print out the transformed data using `console.log()`. The `JSON.stringify(transformedData)` part converts our JavaScript object back into a string so it's easier to display.

### 🎉 Conclusion

By following this example, you can start creating your own scripts to handle various JSON data processing and transformation tasks with GenAIScript. The power of GenAIScript lies in its ability to simplify complex programming tasks through straightforward scripting. Experiment with different transformations and see how you can integrate this into your data workflows!
