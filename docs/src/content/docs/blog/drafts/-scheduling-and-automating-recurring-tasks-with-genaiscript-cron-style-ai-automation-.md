# "Scheduling and Automating Recurring Tasks with GenAIScript: Cron-Style AI Automation"

Modern engineering teams rely on up-to-date documentation and actionable summaries, but manually reviewing, summarizing, and reporting on large sets of content every week is tedious (and let‚Äôs face it, easy to forget). Enter _GenAIScript_: an innovative scripting framework designed to automate AI workloads and content creation as part of your CI/CD, cron jobs, or scheduled GitHub Actions.

In this post, we‚Äôll walk through how to create a GenAIScript script that automatically generates a _weekly summary report_ of your docs ‚Äî and is ready to run unattended on any schedule you choose. We‚Äôll demystify each line, show how to plug it into a cron job or CI system, and share practical automation tips for robust, hands-off reporting.

## Let's Explore the Script Line-by-Line üßë‚Äçüíª

Here‚Äôs what our goal looks like: a script that gathers markdown docs, summarizes recent changes, and writes a clear weekly report that can be used in automated workflows.

```js
script({
    title: "Weekly Automated Content Summary",
    description: "Summarize all markdown documentation files and generate a weekly summary report. Designed to be run on a schedule via cron, GitHub Actions, or CI/CD.",
    files: "docs/**/*.md",
    vars: {
        summaryOutput: "automation/weekly_summary.md"
    }
})
```

**What‚Äôs happening here?**

- `script({...})` is the main entry point for your GenAIScript. This function describes metadata and sets variables for the automation.
- The `title` and `description` fields are for clarity and documentation, so your script is both human and machine friendly.
- `files: "docs/**/*.md"` tells GenAIScript which files to operate on. Here, it grabs _all_ Markdown files in the `docs` directory (recursively).
- `vars` lets us declare custom variables. We‚Äôll save our summary output to `"automation/weekly_summary.md"` for downstream automation or notifications.

---

```js
// 1. Gather all documentation files (markdown)
const docs = def("DOCS", env.files, { endsWith: ".md" })
```

- This line uses `def(name, value, [options])` to declare a variable called `"DOCS"`.
- `env.files` is a built-in value that holds the list of files matched by our `files` pattern.
- `{ endsWith: ".md" }` is an optional filter: here it‚Äôs a sanity check to only include `.md` files, guarding against misconfigured file globs.

---

```js
// 2. Generate a weekly content summary
const summary = $`You are an expert technical writer. Summarize the main updates, new content, and important changes from the following documentation files for this week. Focus on actionable insights and key highlights. Format the summary in markdown with clear sections for "New Content", "Major Updates", and "Other Notable Changes".

${docs}
`
```

- The backtick-quoted `$` syntax is GenAIScript's way of invoking an AI-powered text generation prompt.
- Here, we tell the AI to _act as an expert technical writer_ and analyze the gathered Markdown docs.
- The rich instructions ensure the summaries are organized and actionable ‚Äî grouping by _New Content_, _Major Updates_, and _Other Notable Changes_.
- `${docs}` injects the actual content of the documentation into the prompt for processing.

---

```js
// 3. Save the summary as a markdown file for reporting/notification
def("FILE", {
    filename: env.vars.summaryOutput,
    content: summary,
    language: "markdown"
})
```

- This `def("FILE", {...})` invocation creates an output file as part of the script execution.
- `filename` references the path declared in our `vars` (so you can change it globally).
- `content: summary` writes the AI-generated summary into the file.
- `language: "markdown"` ensures the output is formatted and highlighted properly.

---

```js
// 4. (Optional) Print instruction for integration with cron/GitHub Actions
$`To automate this workflow, schedule this script to run weekly using a cron job, GitHub Actions schedule, or your CI/CD system. The summary will be available at ${env.vars.summaryOutput}.`
```

- This is a pro tip: provide contextual instructions for whoever is running (or inheriting) this script.
- The AI outputs a note on how to wire up the script with cron or CI/CD ‚Äî making onboarding and adoption easier for your future self or teammates.

---

## Integrating with Cron, GitHub Actions, or CI/CD ‚è∞

Once your script is ready, schedule it to run _automatically_ on the cadence you need. Whether it‚Äôs:

- **Cron Job**: Trigger with `0 8 * * 1 genaiscript run script.genai.js` for Mondays at 8am.
- **GitHub Actions**: Use the [`schedule`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#schedule) trigger and call the GenAIScript CLI as a workflow step.
- **Other CI/CD**: Most providers like Azure DevOps, GitLab CI, or CircleCI support schedules.

The generated weekly summary will appear in your chosen output location ‚Äî ready to review, share, or use as input for further automations (like team notifications, dashboards, or status pages).
