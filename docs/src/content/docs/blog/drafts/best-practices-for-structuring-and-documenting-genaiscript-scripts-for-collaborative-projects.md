# "Best Practices for Structuring and Documenting GenAIScript Scripts for Collaborative Projects"

Collaborative development shines when everyone can quickly understand, modify, and extend project code. With GenAIScript, clear script structure and documentation are not just ‚Äúnice to have‚Äù‚Äîthey‚Äôre essential, especially when multiple contributors are involved. If you want to create GenAIScript scripts that are maintainable and teamwork-friendly, this post is for you! Let‚Äôs walk through an annotated example that showcases best practices, one line at a time. üö¶

## Example Script: Annotated, Explained, and Ready for Teams

Below is a GenAIScript example designed for collaborative scenarios. We'll go step by step to explain how each part makes your script clearer and more robust.

```js
/**
 * Script: Collaborative Template Example
 * Description: Demonstrates recommended structure, organization, and documentation practices for GenAIScript scripts in collaborative projects.
 * Author: Your Name
 * Created: 2024-06-01
 * Updated: 2024-06-01
 *
 * # Best Practices Illustrated
 * - Header block with metadata and summary
 * - Section comments for logical organization
 * - Descriptive variable/function names
 * - Inline comments for non-obvious logic
 * - Separation of configuration, logic, and output
 * - Use of defOutputProcessor with documentation
 */
```
**Why is this important?**  
A file header like this or a docstring gives contributors the context at a glance‚Äîwhat this script does, who wrote it, and when it was last updated. Listing the best practices it illustrates serves as a checklist for future maintainers.

---

```js
///////////////////////////////
// 1. CONFIGURATION SECTION //
///////////////////////////////

/**
 * Define script parameters and environment variables here.
 */
const INPUT_FILES = env.files || [];
const OUTPUT_FILENAME = "collaborative-output.txt";
const SUMMARY_PROMPT = `Summarize the main topics and decisions in these files for project onboarding.`;
```
**Section headings** make it easy to spot where configuration happens.  
- `INPUT_FILES = env.files || [];` uses the special ambient variable `env.files`, populated by context (CLI, UI, or workflow). [Docs](https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript/reference/scripts/context/)
- `OUTPUT_FILENAME` and `SUMMARY_PROMPT` are both named to clarify their role, with all-caps constants indicating they shouldn't change at runtime.
- Inline doc explaining this is for setup ensures new contributors know where to adjust defaults.

---

```js
///////////////////////////
// 2. MAIN LOGIC SECTION //
///////////////////////////

/**
 * Main function to process input files and generate a collaborative summary.
 * Each step is documented for clarity in team environments.
 */
async function generateSummary(files) {
    // 2.1: Read and concatenate file contents
    const fileContents = [];
    for (const file of files) {
        // Defensive: skip non-text files
        if (!file.endsWith(".md") && !file.endsWith(".txt") && !file.endsWith(".js")) continue;
        const text = await readFile(file);
        if (typeof text === "string" && text.trim()) fileContents.push(text);
    }
    // 2.2: Combine all content for LLM summarization
    const allContent = fileContents.join("\n\n---\n\n");
    // 2.3: Use LLM to summarize for onboarding
    const summary = await llm(SUMMARY_PROMPT + "\n\n" + allContent);
    return summary;
}
```
**Why this structure?**  
- Grouping logic in a clearly-named function like `generateSummary` improves testability and reusability.
- Numbered inline comments (`2.1`, `2.2`, ...) provide a ‚Äútable of contents‚Äù for each logical action.
- Filtering file types early prevents errors from non-text inputs.
- `await readFile(file);` uses GenAIScript‚Äôs global read helper, found in the [API reference](https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript/reference/scripts/context/#llm-env-and-other-helpers).
- Inline guard conditions (`typeof text === "string" && text.trim()`) catch edge cases with empty files.
- Combining file content for LLM input with clear boundaries (`---`) helps the model generate more organized summaries.
- LLM invocation (`await llm(SUMMARY_PROMPT + ...)`) illustrates the GenAIScript convention of passing a prompt string to the LLM.

```js
//////////////////////////////////////
// 3. OUTPUT PROCESSING & DOCUMENTATION
//////////////////////////////////////

/**
 * Use defOutputProcessor to define collaborative output behavior.
 * This ensures outputs are predictable for all contributors.
 */
defOutputProcessor(async output => {
    // Generate summary from input files
    const summary = await generateSummary(INPUT_FILES);
    // Emit summary to a well-known output file
    return {
        files: {
            [OUTPUT_FILENAME]: summary
        },
        // Optionally, expose summary in the output object for CLI/VSCode
        summary
    };
});

// End of script. All sections above are documented for clarity and maintainability.
```
**Why document output?**  
- The `defOutputProcessor` [API](https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript/reference/scripts/output/) defines how the script ‚Äúemits‚Äù results, making them easy to pick up for post-processing or UI consumption.
- By always writing to a known output file (`collaborative-output.txt`), follow-up automation can rely on consistent output‚Äîcritical for teamwork.
- Exposing the summary directly as a property (`summary`) helps both CLI and code consumers fetch results easily.

## Best Practices in Action üåü

Let‚Äôs recap key collaborative habits this script makes easy:

- **Header Metadata:** Clarifies script purpose and version at a glance.
- **Section Headings and Comments:** Instantly shows where to add or change logic.
- **Self-Documenting Names:** Variables and functions describe their usage; no guesswork.
- **Defensive Programming:** Filtering input and checking for valid content decreases confusion and bugs.
- **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Configuration, main logic, and output are each in well-marked sections.
- **Output Consistency:** The output processor makes results reliable for teams and automation.

## Level Up: Your Hybrid Prompt + Code

GenAIScript isn‚Äôt just about prompt stuffing‚Äîit‚Äôs code AND prompt together. By following these patterns, your scripts stay approachable for your future self and every collaborator.
