You may have noticed that the GenAIScript documentation is now available in **French** (try the upper-right language dropdown).

The translations are not just a one-time effort; they are **continuously** updated as the documentation evolves, in a GitHub Actions. This means that whenever new content is added or existing content is modified, 
the translations are automatically updated to reflect those changes. 

In this post, we'll go through some of the interesting parts of the script and how it works.

## The challenge of translating documentation

The goal of this challenge to maintain localized documentation, and automate the process using GenAIScript, GitHub Actions and GitHub Models.
To be successful, we need:

- a model that can produce high quality translations (LLMs like `gpt-4o` and larger have become quite good at it),
- a iterative strategy to partially translate modified chunks in markdown file. We cannot just translate an entire file other the translations will be changing on every round.
- idempotency: if translations are already available, the results should be cached and the script should be a no-op.
- run automatically in a GitHub Action and use GitHub Models for inference.

Let's get going! If you want to read the code, [here is the script](https://github.com/microsoft/genaiscript/blob/dev/packages/sample/genaisrc/mdtranslator.genai.mts).

## Iterative Markdown Translations

Since GenAISCript uses markdown for documentation, we'll focus on this file format exclusively. GenAIScript also uses [Astro Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) which adds some well-known metadata in the frontmatter like `title` or `description`.

The core idea behind the translation scripts is the following: 

- parse the markdown document into an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)
- visit the tree and collect all the translatable text chunks (special care for paragraphs)
- replace all translatable chunks with a placeholder a `[T001]bla bla bla...[T002]` and prompt the LLM to translate each chunk
- parse the LLM answer, extract each chunk translation, and visit the tree again applying the translations
- save the translations in a cache that they can be reused in a future run

### Markdown AST tools

The web community has been building a large number of tools to parse and manipulate markdown documents. 
GenAIScript provides an opinionated plugin, [@genaiscript/plugin-mdast](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@genaiscript/plugin-mdast) that provides the core functionalities without worrying too much about configuration.

- load the plugin

```ts
import { mdast } from "@genaiscript/plugin-mdast";

const { visit, parse, stringify, SKIP } = await mdast();
```

- parse the markdown file

```ts
const root = parse(file)
```
