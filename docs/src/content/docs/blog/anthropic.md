cover:
  alt: A retro 8-bit illustration depicts a computer screen showcasing
    interconnected nodes in a branching layout, symbolizing collaboration. The
    nodes contain paperclip icons suggesting linking or contributions. At the
    center, a sleek, modern abstract logo stands out. The visual features a
    corporate five-color scheme, comprising blue, green, orange, gray, and
    white, rendered in a clean geometric style.

Big thanks to [@waltoss](https://github.com/waltoss) who contributed the [Anthropic model](https://github.com/microsoft/genaiscript/pull/788) support. There are still some [TODOs](https://github.com/microsoft/genaiscript/discussions/790) but the basics are in place.
