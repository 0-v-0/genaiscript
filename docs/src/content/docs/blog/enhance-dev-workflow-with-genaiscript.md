## Setting Up GenAIScript for Automation

Once you have GenAIScript set up, creating your first automation script is a breeze. Here's a basic example to get you started:

```typescript
import { performTask } from 'genaiscript';

// Sample function to format code
async function formatCode() {
    await performTask('code.format', {
        files: '**/*.ts',
        options: {
            write: true
        }
    });
}

// Execute the formatting task
formatCode().then(() => console.log('Code formatted successfully!'));
```

## Integrating GenAIScript with CI/CD Tools

Integrating GenAIScript with your CI/CD pipeline can streamline your development process. Hereâ€™s how you can use it with GitHub Actions:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    - name: Run GenAIScript
