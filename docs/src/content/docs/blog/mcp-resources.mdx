# MCP Resources

In a [previous post](/genaiscript/blog/script-as-mcp-tools),
we announced how every script can be a [MCP tool](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/tools).

To follow up on this idea, we added support for publishing [MCP resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources)
as part of the script execution.

Resources are a core primitive in the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
that allow servers to expose data and content that can be read by clients and used as context for LLM interactions.

The `publishResource` method allows you to publish a resource with a unique identifier and a file.
The rest of the MCP resource publishing process is handled by the GenAIScript framework.

```js
const uri = await host.publishResource("unique-id", file)
```
