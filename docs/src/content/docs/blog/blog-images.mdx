description: We added images to the blog, this is how we did it.
cover:
  alt: "A retro-style 8-bit illustration features a computer screen with a visible
    code script. Surrounding it are symbolic representations of image
    generation: a markdown document, an image prompt morphing into abstract art,
    and a fading alt-text bubble. The design uses corporate colors, simple
    geometric shapes, and is limited to five colors, without including people or
    text."

excerpt: Generating blog post cover images might sound mundane, but the
  underlying process is a fascinating blend of automation and creativity. By
  converting blog markdown into an image prompt, generating visuals, creating
  alt text, and automating the resizing and integration with frontmatter, this
  script streamlines the entire workflow. Curious how this could enhance your
  content pipeline? Dive in.

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components"
import code from "../../../../genaisrc/blog-image.genai.mts?raw"

We generate cover images to the blog, this in itself is completely unterresting... but the script that generated the images
is worth a look.

The generation of an blog post cover is done in 3 phases:

- convert the blog markdown into an image prompt
- generate an image from the image prompt
- generate an alt text description from the image prompt
- resize, copy image and patch the blog post frontmatter

<Code code={code} lang="ts" wrap title="blog-image.genai.mts" />

Once this script worked for a couple posts,
use used the `convert` command to generate the images for all the blog posts.

```sh
genaiscript convert blog-image blog/*.md*
```

## What about the images?

The images are somewhat abstract, but they are generated from the blog post content.
The image prompt could definitely be improved, but it's a good start.
