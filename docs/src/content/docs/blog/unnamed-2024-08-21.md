## Boost Your Coding Efficiency with GenAIScript: A Complete Guide to FAQ Generation

In today's fast-paced development world, automating mundane tasks can save you significant time and effort. One such task is generating FAQ-style questions from documentation files. In this blog post, we'll explore how to use GenAIScript to generate insightful FAQs that point to other documentation pages, filling gaps in your documentation and enhancing its value for readers.

### What's GenAIScript?

GenAIScript is an innovative framework that lets you create AI-enhanced scripts for various tasks. It's particularly powerful for tasks involving text generation and manipulation, thanks to its integration with large language models (LLMs).

### The Goal

Our goal is to write a GenAIScript prompt generation script to create three FAQ-style questions that are not directly addressed in the documentation file but are relevant for users. These questions will link to other related documentation, offering more comprehensive insights.

### Getting Started with GenAIScript

Before diving into advanced scripting techniques, make sure you're familiar with basic GenAIScript concepts. For an introduction, check out our [gentle introduction to GenAIScript](./gentle-introduction-to-genaiscript.md).

### Writing the Script

Let's break down the steps to write a script that generates FAQ-style questions.

#### 1. Define Your Script Metadata

First, we set the metadata for our script. This includes the title, description, model parameters, and other relevant settings.

```javascript
script({
    title: "FAQ Generator",
    description: "Generates FAQ-style questions pointing to additional documentation.",
    model: "openai:gpt-4",
    temperature: 0.5,
    max_tokens: 500,
});
```

#### 2. Read the Documentation File

We'll use the `fs_read_file` function to read the content of a documentation file.

```javascript
const documentationContent = await fs_read_file({
    filename: "docs/src/content/docs/faq.md"
});
```

#### 3. Generate FAQ-Style Questions

Next, we'll prompt the LLM to generate FAQ-style questions based on the content.

```javascript
const faqQuestions = await $`Given the following documentation content:

${documentationContent}

Generate three FAQ-style questions that are not directly answered in the content but are relevant to the topic. Each question should point to a related documentation page for more information.`;
```

#### 4. Display the Results

Finally, we'll display the generated questions.

```javascript
console.log(faqQuestions);
```

### Full Script Example

Combining all the steps, our complete script looks like this:

```javascript
script({
    title: "FAQ Generator",
    description: "Generates FAQ-style questions pointing to additional documentation.",
    model: "openai:gpt-4",
    temperature: 0.5,
    max_tokens: 500,
});

const documentationContent = await fs_read_file({
    filename: "docs/src/content/docs/faq.md"
});

const faqQuestions = await $`Given the following documentation content:

${documentationContent}

Generate three FAQ-style questions that are not directly answered in the content but are relevant to the topic. Each question should point to a related documentation page for more information.`;

console.log(faqQuestions);
```

### Advanced Techniques

#### Context Variables

Using context variables can be helpful to manage dynamic data in your script. For example:

```javascript
def("DOC_CONTENT", documentationContent);
$`Generate three FAQ questions for the content stored in DOC_CONTENT.`;
```

#### Integrating External APIs

You can also call external APIs within your script for more complex operations.

```javascript
const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
const data = await response.json();

$`Analyze the following data and generate FAQ questions: ${JSON.stringify(data)}`;
```

### Best Practices

- **Keep It Simple:** Break down complex tasks into smaller functions.
- **Reusability:** Create reusable functions for common operations.
- **Testing:** Regularly test your scripts to catch errors early.

### Conclusion

By leveraging the power of GenAIScript, you can automate the generation of FAQ-style questions, enriching your documentation and saving valuable time.
