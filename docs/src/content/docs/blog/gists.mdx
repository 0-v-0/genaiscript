GitHub Gists are a simple way to share and reuse scripts. You can create a Gist from any script in GenAIScript, and then share it with others or use it in your own projects.

For best results, use the [GistPad](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GistPad.gistpad) extension for Visual Studio Code. GistPad allows you to create, edit, and manage your Gists directly from within VS Code.
