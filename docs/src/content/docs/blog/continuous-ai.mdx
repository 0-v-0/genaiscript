description: Exploring LLM-powered automation in platform-based software collaboration
cover:
  alt: A flat, geometric 8-bit depiction of interconnected nodes forming a visual
    network that represents collaborative workflows. The design includes
    mechanical arms symbolizing automation and interlocked gears emphasizing
    synergy. Surrounding the network are icons for AI, software code, and
    deployment pipelines, arranged in a circular, seamless flow. The clean,
    professional design features a limited palette of blue, grey, white, yellow,
    and light green, conveying a modern, tech-oriented theme.

excerpt: AI is reshaping how teams build and collaborate. At GitHub, the concept
  of "Continuous AI" frames a future where AI-powered tools enhance workflows,
  much like CI/CD revolutionized automation in software development. More than a
  single technology, it’s an evolving category of practices and tools designed
  to support collaboration at scale. Initiatives like GitHub Actions, Models,
  and GenAIScripts highlight this direction. How could AI streamline your
  workflows?

From the [GitHub Next blog](https://githubnext.com/projects/continuous-ai/):

> **Continuous AI** is a label we've identified for all uses of automated AI to support software collaboration on any platform. Any use of automated AI to support any software collaboration on any platform anywhere is Continuous AI.

> We've chosen the term "Continuous AI” to align with the established concept of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). Just as CI/CD transformed software development by automating integration and deployment, Continuous AI covers the ways in which AI can be used to automate and enhance collaboration workflows.

>“Continuous AI” is not a term GitHub owns, nor a technology GitHub builds: it's a term we use to focus our minds, and which we're introducing to the industry. This means Continuous AI is an open-ended set of activities, workloads, examples, recipes, technologies and capabilities; a category, rather than any single tool.

Expect more action and synergy around [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), [GitHub Models](https://github.com/features/models), and [GenAIScripts](https://github.com/features/ai/genaiscripts) in the future, as we explore this space.
