excerpt: We've rolled out GenAIScript 2.0, featuring a modular and maintainable
  runtime now accessible in any Node.js application, beyond just the CLI. This
  shift involved significant backend refactoring, streamlining the integration
  process for developers and expanding usage possibilities. The new
  @genaiscript/runtime npm package isolates the core functionality, allowing
  direct imports and straightforward initialization in projects. For those
  building with the Node.js API, updating your imports ensures compatibility
  with the latest structure. This release makes it easier to incorporate
  GenAIScript into diverse workflows, whether through the CLI or embedded in
  broader Node.js solutions.

GenAIScript 2.0 represents a significant architectural milestone. We've fundamentally restructured the codebase to liberate the runtime from CLI dependency, enabling GenAIScript to run natively in any Node.js application.

**Your existing scripts remain largely compatible**. Most changes happen behind the scenes, though we've introduced some breaking changes to the CLI and certain APIs that enhance long-term maintainability.

> The v2.0 release is available in [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/genaiscript) and in Visual Studio Code.

## The Genesis of a Major Refactor

When [Matthew Podwysocki](https://www.linkedin.com/in/podwysocki/) ([@mattpodwysocki](https://github.com/mattpodwysocki)) approached us about contributing to GenAIScript, we initially suggested smaller features to help him get familiar with the codebase. Instead, Matthew saw the bigger picture and proposed **a comprehensive architectural refactoring to create a more modular and maintainable system**.

This suggestion addressed some large technical debt in the project. GenAIScript originated as a research project that evolved organically, accumulating assumptions about its runtime environment. The most significant constraint: scripts could only execute within an augmented Node.js runtime managed by our CLI. This architecture created an artificial barrier—every GenAIScript execution required the CLI as an intermediary.

**Matthew transformed this limitation into an opportunity.** He spearheaded the complex task of [refactoring our entire build system](https://github.com/microsoft/genaiscript/pull/1594), decomposing the monolithic structure into consumable ESM and CommonJS npm packages. This wasn't just a technical upgrade—it fundamentally changed how developers can integrate GenAIScript into their projects.

### Introducing `@genaiscript/runtime`

The new [@genaiscript/runtime](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@genaiscript/runtime) package provides a standalone GenAIScript [runtime](/genaiscript/reference/runtime) that operates independently in any Node.js environment—no CLI wrapper required.

Previously, accessing runtime functionality meant importing a custom export `genaiscript/runtime` from the `genaiscript` package. Now, `@genaiscript/runtime` exists as a dedicated, purpose-built package with a clean API surface.

**Getting started is straightforward:**

<PackageManagers pkg="@genaiscript/runtime" />

```typescript
import { initialize } from "@genaiscript/runtime";

// Initialize before using any global types
await initialize();
```

The initialization process loads global parsers and [inline prompt helpers](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/inline-prompts), preparing the runtime for script execution.

**Important architectural note:** Top-level prompt functions like `$` and `def` remain exclusive to the CLI context, as they depend on CLI-specific initialization. When using the runtime directly, you'll work with inline prompts instead:

```typescript
import { prompt, runPrompt } from "@genaiscript/runtime";

const { text: recipe } = await prompt`write a recipe`;
const { text: poem } = await runPrompt((ctx) => ctx.$`write a poem for this recipe: ${recipe}`);
```

### Unified Development: CLI and Node.js Runtime

This architectural evolution unlocks a powerful new capability: you can now write GenAIScript library code that works seamlessly in both CLI and Node.js environments. This unified approach eliminates the friction of maintaining separate implementations for different deployment contexts.

### Streamlined API Access with `@genaiscript/api`

The [@genaiscript/api](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@genaiscript/api) package delivers a lightweight Node.js runner optimized for [programmatic execution](/genaiscript/reference/api) with minimal runtime dependencies. This package focuses on performance and simplicity, providing just what you need to [run](/genaiscript/reference/api) GenAIScript in production environments.

```typescript
import { run } from "@genaiscript/api";
```
