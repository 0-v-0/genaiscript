description: A reflection about the influence of new image generator and their
  impacts on the software development assets like pull requests.

  alt: A retro 8-bit style illustration features a computer monitor displaying a
    code comparison screen with bright, contrasting code blocks, positioned
    beside an open, abstractly illustrated booklet resembling a zine. The
    backdrop consists of geometric shapes in five corporate colors, creating a
    clean, symbolic scene without any people or written text.

excerpt: Recent progress in AI image generation offers new possibilities for
  documenting and reviewing code changes. By using a two-step process—first
  converting a pull request diff into a visual prompt through a language model
  and then generating images from that prompt—developers can enhance their PRs
  with engaging visual summaries. This approach borrows from the "zine" format,
  blending technical detail with illustration. The workflow can streamline the
  review process by making changes easier to grasp at a glance, potentially
  increasing participation and understanding across teams. With continued
  improvements in generative models, expect even richer ways to present and
  discuss code in the near future.

The availability of new image generators like OpenAI `gpt-image-1` opens
the door to endless new ways to visualize and annotate software artifacts.

## Zines

["Zine"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zine) is a popular graphic art form that combines text and images to tell a story.
Can we prompt the LLM to generate a zine from a pull request diff? _offline robotic voice: Yes we can_.

The script below is a 2 step LLM transformation of the pull request into a zine:

- use `gpt-4.1-mini` to transform the diff into a image generation prompt
- use `gpt-image-1` to generate the image from the prompt
-   - a bit of plumbing to upload the generated image into a branch and add it to the pull request description

## More to come

The zine is a fun way to visualize the pull request diff. It is not perfect but it is inviting
and maybe this is all you need to get someone to review your PR!

There will be more ways to visualize software in the future, thanks to these amazing image generators.
