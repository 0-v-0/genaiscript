Hugging Face [Transformer.js](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/index)
let's you run local model directly from your browser or a Node.JS process.
We can freely use this library from a GenAIScript.

##  Installing transformer.js

You will need to [install](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/installation)
the package locally to reference it in your script.

```sh
npm install -D @xenova/transformers
```

## Importing transformers

The [summarization pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers.js/api/pipelines#pipelinessummarizationpipeline)
specializes in summarizing text. You typically want to allocate a pipeline once
and reuse it over the lifetime of the script.

```js
import { pipeline } from "@xenova/transformers"
const summarizer = await pipeline("summarization")
```

## Using transformers

The `summarizer` object is a locally running model that we can use to summarize each file.

```js "await summarizer(file.content)"
for (const file of env.files) {
    const [summary] = await summarizer(file.content)
    // @ts-ignore
    def("FILE", { filename: file.filename, content: summary.summary_text })
}
```

## To be continued...

There's a ton of other transformers that you could also use in your scripts. Happy modeling.
