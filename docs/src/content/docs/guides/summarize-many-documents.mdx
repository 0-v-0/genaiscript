Suppose I have a directory with multiple `.pdf` (or other) files and I want to run a GenAIScript over all of them.
In this example, I'm generating a catchy tweet for each document and I want to save the tweet in another file.

<Steps>

1. Use the `GenAIScript: Create new script...` command in the command palette to create a new script.
2. This is an easy script.  Assuming the script will take the file as an argument, 
you can refer to that argument in `env.files` and tell the LLM what to do with it:
    ```js
    script({ title: "gen-tweet" })

    def("FILE", env.files)

    $`Given the paper in FILE, write a 140 character summary of the paper 
    that makes the paper sound exciting and encourages readers to look at it.`      
    ```

3. Right click on the document in VS Code Explorer (it can be a `.pdf`, a `.docx`, or a `.md` file) 
because `def` knows how to read and parse all these file types.
Select **Run GenAIScript**. Select the script you just wrote.
4. Assuming we give the GenAIScript a paper describing GenAIScript, the Output will be displayed in a new document tab.
    ```plaintext wrap
    "Discover GenAIScript: a revolutionary scripting language integrating AI to automate complex tasks, making coding accessible to all! #AI #CodingFuture"
    ```
5. Because we didn't tell the LLM to write the output to a file, it will by default go to standard out. 
6. We can confirm this by running the same script from the command line:
    ```plaintext wrap
    npx --yes genaiscript run gen-tweet example1.pdf
    ```
7. The output will be displayed in the terminal.
8. Now that we have the script working for a single file, we can use the command line to apply it to a list of 
files.  Let's assume you start with a file `ex1.pdf` you want the output in a new file `ex1.tweet.md`.
How you do this depends on the shell script you prefer. 
In bash it woud be:
    ```bash
    for file in *.pdf; do newfile="${file%.pdf}.tweet.md";
    npx --yes genaiscript run gen-tweet $file > $newfile
    done
    ```
