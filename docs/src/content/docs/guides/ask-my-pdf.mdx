The quick-start guide illustrates how to write a GenAIScript that takes input from a pdf file.

<Steps>

1. Place your PDF document in a directory visible in VS Code Explorer
2. Use the `GenAIScript: Create new script...` command in the command palette to create a new script.
3. Define and name the pdf file as an input:
    ```js
    const src = def("PDFSOURCE", env.files, { endsWith: ".pdf" })
    ```
4. Replace the text `"TELL THE LLM WHAT TO DO..."` with what you want it to do with your pdf file. Use the name in the def to refer to the file.
    ```js
    // use $ to output formatted text to the prompt
    $`You are a helpful assistant.
    Summarize the content of ${src} and critique the document.
    `
    ```
6. Right click on the pdf document in VS Code Explorer. Select **Run GenAIScript**. Select the script you just wrote.
7. Output will be displayed in a new document tab.
