[Generated Knowledge](https://learnprompting.org/docs/intermediate/generated_knowledge)
is a prompting technique where one first asks the LLM a question to generate facts, 
then uses the generated answer to answer a question correctly.

This technique can be acheived by using [runPrompt](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/inline-prompts)
to execute an LLM request and use it in the final prompt.
