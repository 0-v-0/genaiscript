You will need to configure the LLM connection and authorizion secrets. GenAIScript uses a `.env` file to store the secrets (this file should never be commited to your source control!)

```txt
OPENAI_API_KEY="..."
```

GenAiScript supports OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, as well as locally-hosted models. See [authorization information](/genaiscript/reference/token).
