## Install in Visual Studio Code

GenAiScript is available as a Visual Studio Code Extension. It is not yet available in the marketplace or npm as it is not public yet. These are the manual steps to install the extension:

-   install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download),
-   open the [latest release](https://github.com/microsoft/genaiscript/releases/latest/) on GitHub (if you are getting a 404 page, you need to sign in),
-   download the `genaiscript.vsix` into your project in VSCode
-   right click on the `.vsix` file and select **Install Extension VSIX...**

Repeat these steps each time you need to upgrade (annoying, I know).
