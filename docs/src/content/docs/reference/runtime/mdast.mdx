These runtime helpers provide a friendly wrapper around the [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark), [mdast](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast), [unified](https://github.com/syntax-tree/unist)
ecosystem to parse and manipulate Markdown documents.

In order to get type completion, you will need to install the `@types/mdast` package as a development dependency.

<PackageManagers pkg="@types/mdast" dev />

## Markdown manipulation

- parsing to mdast tree

```typescript
const root = await mdastParse("# Hello World");
```

- visiting the tree (see [documentation](https://unifiedjs.com/learn/recipe/tree-traversal/pnp))

```typescript
const updated = await mdastVisit(root, `code`, (node) => {
  ...node
});
```

- serializing the tree back to Markdown

```typescript
const markdown = await mdastStringify(updated);
```
