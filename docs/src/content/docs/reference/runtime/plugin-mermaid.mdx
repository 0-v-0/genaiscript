import { PackageManagers } from "starlight-package-managers";

[MermaidJs](https://mermaid.js.org/) is a popular diagramming tool that allows you to create diagrams using a simple text syntax. The GenAIScript mermaid plugin provides a way to parse and render Mermaid diagrams within your GenAIScript applications.

The [@genaiscript/plugin-mermaid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@genaiscript/plugin-mermaid) package supports parsing mermaid diagrams. This can be useful to repair diagrams created by LLMs.

## Installation

<PackageManagers pkg="@genaiscript/plugin-mermaid" dev />

## Usage

```ts
import { parse } from "@genaiscript/plugin-mermaid";

const res = await parse(`
  graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
`);
```

## Why this plugin?

The mermaid toolchain is meant to run in a browser environment, so it requires a bit of special work to make it work in Node.JS. Additionally, the [mermaid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mermaid) package is quite large, so we decided to make it a plugin that you can install only if you need it.
