description: Learn how to run GenAIScript scripts in a Node.JS environment, including configuration

Scripts using the `.genai.mts` (or any `.genai.*` extension) are meant to be run through the [command line interfanece](/genaiscript/reference/cli).

This page describes how to use the runtime in a Node.JS script without using the CLI.

## Import and configuration

```js
import { initialize } from "@genaiscript/runtime";

// runs this before using any global ty\pes
await initialize();
```

## globals
