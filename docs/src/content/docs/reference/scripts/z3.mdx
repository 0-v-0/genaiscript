[Z3](https://microsoft.github.io/z3guide/) is a high-performance theorem prover developed at Microsoft Research. It is a built-in tool of GenAIScript. Z3 is used to solve logical formulas
and can be used for various applications, including program verification, constraint solving, and symbolic execution.

GenAIScript uses the WebAssembly-based [z3-solver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/z3-solver) npm package to run Z3.

## Z3 tool

The `z3` tool (in [system.z3](/genaiscript/scripts/systems#systemz3)) script wraps Z3 as a LLM tool that can be used in GenAIScript.
The tool takes a SMTLIB2 formula as input and returns the Z3 output.

```js
script({
    tools: "z3"
})

script({
    title: "Use Z3 tool to solve SMT2 problems",
    tools: "z3",
})

$`Solve the following problems using Z3:

(declare-const a Int)
(declare-fun f (Int Bool) Int)
(assert (< a 10))
(assert (< (f a true) 100))
(check-sat)
```
