## User experience

This diagram demonstrates the AI-enhanced workflow process in genaiscript. The gpspec starts the `script`, which reads the `gpspec`, interacts with the gpvm and foundation model.
The AI-generated output is used to update the workspace, and the user interacts with the updated workspace through the genaiscript extension to VS code.

### Fork a tool

-   open the command palette
-   type "Fork a GenAiScript..." and select the tool you want to fork
-   pick a new name and start editing the tool

The tool will be available in the dropdown of the "Run GenAiScript..." command.

### Create a gpspec

The default gpspec generated by GenAIScript is rather simplistic. You can improve the performance of the LLM
by creating a new gpspec with more instructions.

## Copilot Chat integration (requires Visual Studio Code Insiders)

When invoking the **@genaiscript** agent, the agent will aggregate the conversation
into a script script and execute it. This is a great way to explore the capabilities of GenAIScript and interactively create a new script script.
