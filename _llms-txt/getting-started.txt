# Getting Started

> Start developing with the GenAIScript VS Code Extension to create AI scripts efficiently.

GenAIScript is a scripting language that integrates LLMs into the scripting process using a simplified JavaScript syntax. Supported by our VS Code GenAIScript extension, it allows users to create, debug, and automate LLM-based scripts. [Play](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ENunZe--7j0) ## Preamble [Section titled “Preamble”](#preamble) Before you start writing GenAIScripts, you will need to configure your environment to have access to a LLM. The [configuration](/genaiscript/getting-started/configuration) covers this topic in details as they are a lot of options to consider. ## Hello World [Section titled “Hello World”](#hello-world) A GenAIScript is a JavaScript program that builds an LLM which is then executed by the GenAIScript runtime. Let’s start with a simple script that tells the LLM to generate a poem. In typical use, GenAIScript files have the naming convention `<scriptname>.genai.mjs` and are stored in the `genaisrc` directory in a repository. Let’s call this script `poem.genai.mjs`. poem.genai.mjs ```js $`Write a poem in code.` ``` The `$...` syntax is [template literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) that renders to a user message to the LLM prompt. In this example, it would be: ```txt Write a poem in code. ``` In practice, your script may also import [system scripts](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/system) (automatically or manually specified) that add more messages to the requests. So the final JSON payload sent to the LLM server might look more like this: ```js { ... messages: [ { role: "system", content: "You are helpful. ..." }, { role: "user", content: "Write a poem in code." } ] } ``` GenAIScripts can be executed from the [command line](/genaiscript/reference/cli) or run with a right-click context menu selection inside Visual Studio Code. Because a GenAIScript is just JavaScript, the execution of a script follows the normal JavaScript evaluation rules. Once the script is executed, the generated messages are sent to the LLM server, and the response is processed by the GenAIScript runtime. * npm ```sh npx genaiscript run poem ``` * pnpm ```sh pnpx genaiscript run poem ``` * yarn ```sh yarn dlx genaiscript run poem ``` Here is an example output for this prompt (shortened) that got returned by OpenAI gpt-4o. ````markdown ```python def poem(): # In the silence of code, ... # And thus, in syntax sublime, # We find the art of the rhyme. ``` ```` GenAIScript supports extracting structured data and files from the LLM output as we will see later. ## Variables [Section titled “Variables”](#variables) GenAIScripts support a way to declare [prompt variables](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/context), which allow to include content into the prompt and to refer to it later in the script. Let’s take a look at a `summarize` script that includes the content of a file and asks the LLM to summarize it. summarize.genai.mjs ```js def("FILE", workspace.readText("some/relative/markdown.txt")) $`Summarize FILE in one sentence.` ``` In this snippet, we use `workspace.readText` to read the content of a file (path relatie to workspace root) and we use `def` to include it in the prompt as a `prompt variable`. We then “referenced” this variable in the prompt. prompt ````markdown FILE: ```text file="some/relative/markdown.txt" What is Markdown? Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup languages. ``` Summarize FILE in one sentence. ```` The `def` function supports many configuration flags to control how the content is included in the prompt. For example, you can insert line numbers or limit the number of tokens. ```js def("FILE", ..., { lineNumbers: true, maxTokens: 100 }) ``` ## Files parameters [Section titled “Files parameters”](#files-parameters) GenAIScript are meant to work on a file or set of files. When you run a script in Visual Studio Code on a file or a folder, those files are passed to the script using the `env.files` variable. You can use this `env.files` to replace hard-coded paths and make your scripts more resuable. summarize.genai.mjs ```js // summarize all files in the env.files array def("FILE", env.files) $`Summarize FILE in one sentence.` ``` And now apply it to a bunch of files * npm ```sh npx genaiscript run summarize "**/*.md" ``` * pnpm ```sh pnpx genaiscript run summarize "**/*.md" ``` * yarn ```sh yarn dlx genaiscript run summarize "**/*.md" ``` ## Processing outputs [Section titled “Processing outputs”](#processing-outputs) GenAIScript processes the outputs of the LLM and extracts files, diagnostics and code sections when possible. Let’s update the summarizer script to specify an output file pattern. summarize.genai.mjs ```js // summarize all files in the env.files array def("FILE", env.files) $`Summarize each FILE in one sentence. Save each generated summary to "<filename>.summary"` ``` Given this input, the model returns a string, which the GenAIScript runtime interprets based on what the prompt requested from the model: ````markdown File src/samples/markdown-small.txt.summary: ```text Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber in 2004, known for adding formatting elements to plaintext text documents. ``` ```` Because the prompt requested that a file be written, the model has responded with content describing the contents of the file that should be created. In this case, the model has chosen to call that file `markdown-small.txt.summary`. Our GenAIScript library parses the LLM output, interprets it, and in this case will create the file. If the script is invoked in VS Code, the file creation is exposed to the user via a [Refactoring Preview](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/refactoring#_refactor-preview) or directly saved to the file system. Of course, things can get more complex - with functions, schemas, … -, but this is the basic flow of a GenAIScript script. If you’re looking for an exhaustive list of prompting techniques, checkout [the prompt report](https://learnprompting.org/). ## Using tools [Section titled “Using tools”](#using-tools) [Tools](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/tools) are a way to register JavaScript callbacks with the LLM, they can be used execute code, search the web, … or read files! Here is an example of a script that uses the [`fs_read_file`](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/system#systemfs_read_file) tool to read a file and summarize it: summarize.genai.mjs ```js script({ tools: "fs_read_file" }) $` - read the file markdown.md - summarize it in one sentence. - save output to markdown.md.txt ` ``` A possible trace looks like as follows. As you can see we are not using the `def` function anymore, we expect the LLM to issue a call to the `fs_read_file` tool to read the file `markdown.md` so that it receives the content of that file. Note that this approach is less deterministic than using `def` as the LLM might not call the tool. Moreover it uses more tokens as the LLM has to generate the code to call the tool. Nonetheless, it is a powerful way to interact with the LLM. ## Using agents [Section titled “Using agents”](#using-agents) You can add one more layer of indirection and use [agent\_fs](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/system#systemagent_fs), a file system [agent](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/agents), to read the file. The agent combines a call to an LLM, and a set of tools related to file system queries. summarize.genai.mjs ```js script({ tools: "agent_fs" }) $` - read the file src/rag/markdown.md - summarize it in one sentence. - save output to file markdown.md.txt (override existing) ` ``` ## Next steps [Section titled “Next steps”](#next-steps) While GenAIScripts can be written with any IDE and run from the command line, users of the [extension in Visual Studio Code](/genaiscript/getting-started/installation) greatly benefit from the additional support for writing, debugging, and executing GenAIScript provided. We strongly recommend starting by installing the extension.

# Automating scripts

> Learn how to automate your scripts using the GenAIScript CLI for efficient batch processing and integration into CI/CD pipelines.

Once you have a script that you are happy with, you can automate it using the [command line interface](/genaiscript/reference/cli). ## Running a script using the CLI [Section titled “Running a script using the CLI”](#running-a-script-using-the-cli) The basic usage of the CLI is to [run](/genaiscript/reference/cli/run/) a script with a tool name and a list of files. ```sh npx --yes genaiscript run <script_id> <...files> ``` where `<script_id>` is the name of the script (e.g. filename without `.genai.mjs`) and `<...files>` is a list of files to run the script on. The CLI will use the secrets in the `.env` file, populate `env.files` with `<...files>`, run the script and emit the output to the standard output. You can use the CLI to run your scripts in a CI/CD pipeline. The CLI will return a non-zero exit code if the script fails, which can be used to fail the pipeline. ### Apply Edits [Section titled “Apply Edits”](#apply-edits) Add the `--apply-edits` flag to the CLI to automatically write the file edits. ```sh npx --yes genaiscript run <script> <...files> --apply-edits ``` Caution An LLM may generate arbitrary code that can be harmful to your system. We recommend that you review the modified code before executing it. This could be done through a separate branch and a pull request. You can also use a [container](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/container) to run the script in a sandboxed environment. Refer to [Security and Trust](/genaiscript/reference/security-and-trust) for more discussion. ## GitHub Action [Section titled “GitHub Action”](#github-action) [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. This section explains how to integrate your GenAIScript in GitHub Actions workflows and pull requests. [GitHub Models](https://github.com/marketplace/models) provide a integrated way to run LLM inference from a GitHub Action. ### Configure GitHub Models [Section titled “Configure GitHub Models”](#configure-github-models) To use GitHub Models, you must add the `models: read` permission to your workflow, pass the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret to the cli, and configure the cli to use GitHub Models. This can be done by setting the LLM provider to `github` in cli. ```yaml permissions: models: read ... - run: npx --yes genaiscript run <script> <...files> --provider github env: GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} ``` ### Configure secrets and variables [Section titled “Configure secrets and variables”](#configure-secrets-and-variables) Configure the [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions) and [variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/variables) on your repository or organization so that GenAIScript can connect to your LLM. The secrets and variables should match the `.env` file in your local environment. ### Running a script [Section titled “Running a script”](#running-a-script) Use the [cli](/genaiscript/reference/cli/run/) to run the script in a GitHub Action. * Make sure to pass the secrets and variables to the script to give access to the LLM. * use the `--out <path>` flag to store the results in a directory so that you can upload them as an artifact. ```yaml - run: npx --yes genaiscript run <script> <...files> --out results env: # variables OPENAI_API_TYPE: ${{ env.OPENAI_API_TYPE }} OPENAI_API_BASE: ${{ env.OPENAI_API_BASE }} # secret, redacted OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }} ``` ### Add the trace to the action summary [Section titled “Add the trace to the action summary”](#add-the-trace-to-the-action-summary) Use the `out-trace` flag to output the trace to the summary file, `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY` (see [example](https://github.com/microsoft/genaiscript/actions/runs/9370477073#summary-25797526178)). ```yaml - run: npx --yes genaiscript run ... --out-trace $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY ``` ### Diff [Section titled “Diff”](#diff) You can use `git.diff` to execute a [git](https://git-scm.com/) `diff` command to retrieve changes in the current branch. ```js const changes = await git.diff({ base: "main" }) def("GIT_DIFF", changes, { language: "diff", maxTokens: 20000, }) ``` Note that you’ll need to pull `origin/main` branch to make this command work in an action. ```yaml - run: git fetch origin && git pull origin main:main ``` ### Storing output in artifacts [Section titled “Storing output in artifacts”](#storing-output-in-artifacts) Ensure that the directory containing the results is uploaded as an artifact. You can review the trace by opening the `res.trace.md` file. in the zipped artifact. ```yaml - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4 if: always() with: path: | genairesults/** ``` ### Azure OpenAI with a Service Principal [Section titled “Azure OpenAI with a Service Principal”](#azure-openai-with-a-service-principal) The official documentation of the [azure login action](https://github.com/Azure/login?tab=readme-ov-file#azure-login-action) contains detailed steps on configure Azure resource access from GitHub Actions. 1. Create a Service Principal following [connect from azure secret](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure-secret#prerequisites) guide. 2. Assign any role to the service principal (e.g. **Reader**) in your Azure subscription. You need this to login. 3. Assign the role **Cognitive Services OpenAI User** to the service principal. You need this so that the service principal can access the OpenAI resource. 4. Configure the [AZURE\_CREDENTIALS](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/github/connect-from-azure-secret#create-a-github-secret-for-the-service-principal) secret in your GitHub repository with the service principal credentials. ```json { "clientId": "<Client ID>", "clientSecret": "<Client Secret>", "subscriptionId": "<Subscription ID>", "tenantId": "<Tenant ID>" } ``` 5. Configure the `AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT` in your repository GitHub Action variables. 6. Add the following step in your workflow to your GitHub action to login to Azure. genai.yml ```yaml - name: Azure Login action uses: azure/login@v2 with: creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }} ``` 7. Update each step that invokes the [cli](/genaiscript/reference/cli) to include the `AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT` variable. ```yaml - name: run genai script run: npx --yes genaiscript run ... env: AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT: ${{ env.AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT }} ``` ## GitHub Pull request [Section titled “GitHub Pull request”](#github-pull-request) If your GitHub Action is triggered by a [pull request event](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request), you can use the following flags to add comments: description, conversation and reviews. In order to create comments, the workflow must have the `pull-requests: write` [permission](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/assigning-permissions-to-jobs) and the `GITHUB_TOKEN` secret must be passed to the script. ```yaml permissions: pull-requests: write ... - run: npx --yes genaiscript run ... env: GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} ... ``` ### Update Description [Section titled “Update Description”](#update-description) The `--pull-request-description` inserts the LLM output into the pull request section (see [example](https://github.com/microsoft/genaiscript/pull/504)). The command takes an optional string argument to uniquely identify this comment, it is used to update the comment (default is the script id). ```yaml - run: npx --yes genaiscript run --pull-request-description ``` If you want to run this script when the pull request is ready for review, use the [`ready_for_review`](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request), `opened`, `reopened` events. ```yaml on: pull_request: types: [ready_for_review, opened, reopened] ``` ### Conversation comment [Section titled “Conversation comment”](#conversation-comment) The `--pull-request-comment` adds the LLM output as a comment to the pull request conversation (see [example](https://github.com/microsoft/genaiscript/pull/504#issuecomment-2145273728)). The optional argument is an identifier for the comment (default is the script id) so that only one comment appears for the id. ```yaml - run: npx --yes genaiscript run --pull-request-comment env: ... ``` ### Review comments [Section titled “Review comments”](#review-comments) Use the `--pull-request-reviews` to convert [annotations](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/annotations) as review comments **to the last commit** on the pull request (see [example](https://github.com/microsoft/genaiscript/pull/504#pullrequestreview-2093960791)). ```yaml - run: npx --yes genaiscript run --pull-request-reviews env: ... ``` GenAIScript will automatically try to ignore duplicate review comments and only create new ones. To collect the changes of the last commit in the pull request branch (see [cool blog post](https://www.kenmuse.com/blog/the-many-shas-of-a-github-pull-request/)), you can try this git command: ```js const { stdout: changes } = await host.exec("git", [ "diff", "HEAD^", "HEAD", "--", "**.ts", ]) ```

# Best Practices

> Suggestions for using GenAIScripts more effectively

## GenAIScript allows chatbot users to create reusable scripts [Section titled “GenAIScript allows chatbot users to create reusable scripts”](#genaiscript-allows-chatbot-users-to-create-reusable-scripts) If you have used an LLM-based chatbot, like ChatGPT, you are familiar with the kinds of things that LLMs can do that ordinary software (that doesn’t use LLMs) cannot. For example, LLMs can review a document, write poetry, and analyze images, just as a starting point (with the caveat that sometimes they make mistakes). GenAIScript allows you to write a prompt that is embedded in a JavaScript framework so that the prompt can be parameterized, tested, debugged, reused, and run from a command line. ## Given the model the context it needs from documents [Section titled “Given the model the context it needs from documents”](#given-the-model-the-context-it-needs-from-documents) GenAIScript allows users to add documents to their prompts. This allows the LLM to have more background information related to the task it is being asked to do. In a GenAIScript, the JavaScript [`def`](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/context) command gives the LLM the contents of a document and defines a name that can be used in the prompt to refer to that document. Standard document formats, like [pdf](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/pdf) and [docx](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/docx) are supported so you just have to name the files and our libraries will extract the text automatically. You can parameterize the input context further using [`env.files`](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/context). ## Focus a GenAIScript on having the LLM do 1 thing well [Section titled “Focus a GenAIScript on having the LLM do 1 thing well”](#focus-a-genaiscript-on-having-the-llm-do-1-thing-well) Say I wanted to use a GenAIScript to write a white paper. Instead of asking the model to write the whole paper as one prompt, I would divide the task into different parts: write the introduction, write the recommendations, write the conclusion, etc. By breaking down the problem into subproblems, you can debug the script to accomplish the specific task well and then move on. ## Use the output of 1 GenAIScript as input to another [Section titled “Use the output of 1 GenAIScript as input to another”](#use-the-output-of-1-genaiscript-as-input-to-another) Combining the two points above, you can create a collection of inter-related scripts that accomplish a more ambitious goal. Depending on your level of expertise, the combination can be accomplished by using the command line interface to the scripts [CLI](/genaiscript/reference/cli) and using traditional software to connect them. ## Use the right LLM or other foundation model for the task [Section titled “Use the right LLM or other foundation model for the task”](#use-the-right-llm-or-other-foundation-model-for-the-task) There are currently many different choices of AI models. We outline how to connect many of these with GenAIScript in [configuration](/genaiscript/getting-started/configuration). They vary in capabilities and cost, with some being available as open source and usable (with the right GPU) for free. Consult the documentation for the specific LLM or other model you are using to understand how to write prompts that effectively communicate the task you want the AI to perform. Parameters between LLMs vary, for example, the size of the input context allowed, so make sure that the content you want to communicate to the LLM fits in its context window size.

# Configuration

> Set up your LLM connection and authorization with environment variables for seamless integration.

You will need to [configure](/genaiscript/configuration) the LLM connection and authorization secrets. You can use remote (like OpenAI, Azure, etc.) and local models (like Ollama, Jan, LMStudio, etc.) with GenAIScript. There are a few shortcuts where GenAIScript will automatically detect the configuration; otherwise, you’ll want to follow [the configuration instructions](/genaiscript/configuration). * in Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot Chat installed, GenAIScript will automatically use the Copilot Chat models * in a GitHub Codespace, GenAIScript will automatically use GitHub Models * if Ollama is running, GenAIScript will automatically use the Ollama models **If none of these scenario apply, follow [the configuration instructions](/genaiscript/configuration).** ## Next steps [Section titled “Next steps”](#next-steps) Write your [first script](/genaiscript/getting-started/your-first-genai-script).

# Debugging Scripts

> Learn how to debug GenAIScript files using Visual Studio Code Debugger to efficiently troubleshoot and enhance your JavaScript automation scripts.

The GenAIScript script files are executable JavaScript and can be debugged using the [Visual Studio Code Debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging), just like any other JavaScript program. ![A screenshot of a debugging session in a code editor with a breakpoint set on a line of code. The editor is displaying several panels including the watch variables, call stack, and a terminal output. The code is partially visible with a function definition and JSON configuration data. ](/genaiscript/_astro/debugger.VhgOO6-1_ZMKDkn.webp) ## Starting a debugging session [Section titled “Starting a debugging session”](#starting-a-debugging-session) * Open the `.genai.mjs` file to debug and add breakpoints. ### From the env files [Section titled “From the env files”](#from-the-env-files) * Right click in the editor of the file you want in `env.files`. * Select the GenAIScript from the picker. #### From the script itself [Section titled “From the script itself”](#from-the-script-itself) * Add a `files` field in the `script` function ```js script({ ..., files: "*.md" }) ``` * Click on the **Debug** icon button on the editor menu (hidden under the run button). The debugger will launch the [cli](/genaiscript/reference/cli) and run the script in debug mode. The debugger will stop at the breakpoints you set. ## Limitations [Section titled “Limitations”](#limitations) The JavaScript executes in an external node process. Therefore, * The trace preview and output is not supported while debugging. ## Next steps [Section titled “Next steps”](#next-steps) Keep iterating the script or [add tests](/genaiscript/getting-started/testing-scripts).

# Running scripts

> Discover how to run scripts in your development environment, manage script execution, and interpret the results for enhanced productivity.

Caution Script are executed in the context of your environment. **Only run trusted scripts.** ## Visual Studio Code [Section titled “Visual Studio Code”](#visual-studio-code) In Visual Studio Code, the location where you start running a script determines the entries in the [`env.files`](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/context) variable. [Play](https://youtube.com/watch?v=dM8blQZvvJg) ### Single file [Section titled “Single file”](#single-file) * Right click on a file in the Explorer and select **Run GenAIScript…**. * Or right click in a file editor and select **Run GenAIScript…**. The `env.files` array will contain a single element with the selected file. ![A file explorer window shows various files and folders. The file "Document.docx" is selected, and a context menu is open with the option "Run GenAIScript..." highlighted.](/genaiscript/_astro/vscode-file-run.D2SuwhFv_Z9M0xU.webp) ### Folder [Section titled “Folder”](#folder) * Right click on a folder in the Explorer and select \*\*Run GenAIScript…\*\*s. The `env.files` array will contain all nested files under that folder. ![The image shows a file explorer with a context menu. The "rag" folder is expanded, displaying files like "Document.docx." The context menu includes options like "New File," "Cut," "Copy," and "Run GenAIScript."](/genaiscript/_astro/vscode-folder-run.CqqhNtdL_sRgAa.webp) ### GitHub Copilot Chat [Section titled “GitHub Copilot Chat”](#github-copilot-chat) You can run scripts in the [GitHub Copilot Chat](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/getting-started-chat) through the [**@genaiscript**](/genaiscript/reference/vscode/github-copilot-chat) participant. ![A screenshot of the chat participant window.](/genaiscript/_astro/chat-participant.BsdSg1Yh_u2VpW.webp) ### Default files [Section titled “Default files”](#default-files) You can specify default file or files to run the script on. When you run the script from the script file itself, or with the command line without file arguments, the default files will be used. ```js script({ files: "path/to/files*.md", }) ... ``` ### Tasks [Section titled “Tasks”](#tasks) The GenAIScript extension exposes each script as a [Task](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks) automatically. The task launches the [cli](/genaiscript/reference/cli) and runs the selected script and pass the path to the current opened editor. * Open the command palette `Ctrl+Shift+P` and search “Tasks: Run Task” * Select the `genaiscript` task provider * Select the script you want to run ### Analyze results [Section titled “Analyze results”](#analyze-results) By default, GenAIScript opens the output preview which shows a rendered view of the LLM output (assuming the LLM produces markdown). The GenAIScript view provides an overview of the trace of the latest run. You can also use the **Trace** to review the each transformation step of the script execution. * Click on the GenAIScript status bar icon to various options to investigate results. ![A screenshot of a code editor shows a dropdown menu with "Retry," "Output," and "Trace" options, JSON data listing cities and populations, and a status bar indicating "150 tokens" generated by AI.](/genaiscript/_astro/vscode-statusbar-trace.Dnrt9G-1_8INE6.webp) ## Command Line [Section titled “Command Line”](#command-line) Start by creating a script using the [command line](/genaiscript/reference/cli). * JavaScript ```sh npx genaiscript scripts create proofreader ``` * TypeScript “—typescript” ```sh npx genaiscript scripts create proofreader --typescript ``` The `scripts create` command also drops a TypeScript definition file (`genaiscript.d.ts` and `tsconfig.json`) to enable type checking and auto-completion in your editor. If you need to regenerate the TypeScript definition file, use the `scripts fix` ```sh npx genaiscript scripts fix ``` Use the [run](/genaiscript/reference/cli/run) command to execute a script from the command line. ```sh npx genaiscript run proofreader path/to/files*.md ``` You can start a [playground](/genaiscript/reference/playground) to interactively run scripts through a similar web interface as the Visual Studio Code extension. ```sh npx genaiscript serve ``` ## Next steps [Section titled “Next steps”](#next-steps) [Debug](/genaiscript/getting-started/debugging-scripts) your scripts using the Visual Studio Code Debugger! ## Other integrations [Section titled “Other integrations”](#other-integrations) These are not actively maintained by the GenAIScript team, but we try to make them work as much as possible. If you find dragons, please report the issues. ### Cursor [Section titled “Cursor”](#cursor) GenAIScript can be installed in [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/how-to-install-extension) using the manual installation steps. ### [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) [Section titled “Neovim”](#neovim) The [genaiscript-runner.nvim](https://github.com/ryanramage/genaiscript-runner.nvim) project provides a plugin to run GenAIScript scripts.

# Testing scripts

> Learn how to declare and run tests for your scripts to ensure their correctness and reliability.

It is possible to declare [tests](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/tests) in the `script` function to validate the output of the script. ## Declaring tests [Section titled “Declaring tests”](#declaring-tests) The tests are added as an array of objects in the `tests` key of the `script` function. proofreader.genai.mjs ```js script({ ..., tests: { files: "src/rag/testcode.ts", rubrics: "is a report with a list of issues", facts: `The report says that the input string should be validated before use.`, } }) ``` ## Specifiying models [Section titled “Specifiying models”](#specifiying-models) You can also specify a set of models (and model aliases) to run the tests against. Each test will be run against each model. proofreader.genai.mjs ```js script({ ..., testModels: [ "azure_ai_inference:gpt-4o", "azure_ai_inference:gpt-4o-mini", "azure_ai_inference:deepseek-r1", ], }) ``` The `testModels` can be also overriden through the command line. ## Running tests [Section titled “Running tests”](#running-tests) ### Visual Studio Code [Section titled “Visual Studio Code”](#visual-studio-code) * Open the [Test Explorer view](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/testing). * Select your script in the tree and click the `play` icon button. ![Visual Studio Test Explorer opened with a few genaiscript tests.](/genaiscript/_astro/vscode-test-explorer.DHobrdnh_1FDdux.webp) ### Command Line [Section titled “Command Line”](#command-line) Run this command from the workspace root. ```sh npx genaiscript test proofreader ``` ## Known limitations [Section titled “Known limitations”](#known-limitations) Currently, promptfoo treats the script source as the prompt text. Therefore, one cannot use assertions that also rely on the input text, such as `answer_relevance`. * Read more about [tests](/genaiscript/reference/scripts/tests) in the reference. ## Next steps [Section titled “Next steps”](#next-steps) [Automate](/genaiscript/getting-started/automating-scripts) script execution using the command line interface ([CLI](/genaiscript/reference/cli)).

# Tutorial Notebook

> Learn how to use GenAIScript with this interactive tutorial notebook featuring executable JavaScript code blocks.

This Notebook is a GenAIScript tutorial. It is a Markdown document where each JavaScript code section is a runnable GenAIScript. You can execute each code block individually and see the results in the output section below the code block. To open this notebook in Visual Studio Code, press **F1** and run **GenAIScript: Create GenAIScript Markdown Notebook**. Follow the steps in [configuration](https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript/getting-started/configuration) to set up your environment and LLM access. ## Prompt as code [Section titled “Prompt as code”](#prompt-as-code) GenAIScript lets you write prompts as a JavaScript program. GenAIScript runs your program; generate chat messages; then handles the remaining interaction with the LLM API. ### Write to prompt `$` [Section titled “Write to prompt $”](#write-to-prompt) Let’s start with a simple hello world program. ```js $`Say "hello!" in emojis` ``` <!-- genaiscript output start --> <!-- genaiscript output end --> The `$` function formats the strings and write them to the user message. This user message is added to the chat messages and sent to the LLM API. Under the snippet, you can review both the **user** message (that our program generated) and the **assistant** (LLM) response. You can run the code block by clicking the **Execute Cell** button on the top left corner of the code block. It will be default try to use the LLMs from various providers. If you need to use a different model, update the `model` field in the front matter at the start of the document. There are many options documented in [configuration](https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript/getting-started/configuration). Once the execution is done, you will also an additional **trace** entry that allows you to dive in the internal details of the GenAIScript execution. This is very helpful to diagnose issues with your prompts. The trace can be quite large so it is not serialized in the markdown file. You can use the JavaScript `for` loop and sequence multiple `$` calls to append text to the user message. You can also inner expression to generate dynamic content. ```js // let's give 3 tasks to the LLM // to get 3 different outputs for (let i = 1; i <= 3; i++) $`- Say "hello!" in ${i} emojis.` $`Respond with a markdown list` ``` <!-- genaiscript output start --> <!-- genaiscript output end --> To recap, the GenAIScript runs and generates a user messages; that gets sent to the LLM. You can review the user message (and others) in the trace. ## `def` and `env.files` [Section titled “def and env.files”](#def-and-envfiles) The [`def` function](https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript/reference/scripts/context/#definition-def) lets you declare and assign **LLM variables**. The concept of variable is most useful to import context data, in particular files, and refer to them in the rest of the prompt. ```js def("FILE", env.files) $`Summarize FILE in one short sentence. Respond as plain text.` ``` <!-- genaiscript output start --> <!-- genaiscript output end --> In GenAIScript, the [`env.files`](https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript/reference/scripts/context/#environment-env) variable contains the [list of files in context](https://microsoft.github.io/genaiscript/reference/script/files), which can be determined by a user selection in the UI, CLI arguments, or pre-configured like in this script. You can change the files in `env.files` by editing the `files` field in the front matter at the start of the document. ### Filtering `env.files` [Section titled “Filtering env.files”](#filtering-envfiles) When using GenAIScript from the user interface, it is common to apply a script to an entire folder. This means that you’ll get a bunch of files in `env.files` including some unneeded ones. The `def` function provides various options to filter the files, like the `endsWith` option. `def` also provides `maxTokens` which will trim the content size to a number of tokens. LLM context is finite! ```js script({ files: "src/**" }) // glob all files under src/samples def("FILE", env.files, { endsWith: ".md", maxTokens: 1000 }) // only consider markdown files $`Summarize FILE in one short sentence. Respond as plain text.` ``` <!-- genaiscript output start --> <!-- genaiscript output end --> ## Tools [Section titled “Tools”](#tools) You can register JavaScript functions as tools that the LLM will call as needed. ```js // requires openai, azure openai or github models defTool( "fetch", "Download text from a URL", { url: "https://..." }, ({ url }) => host.fetchText(url) ) $`Summarize https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/genaiscript/main/README.md in 1 sentence.` ``` ## Sub-prompt [Section titled “Sub-prompt”](#sub-prompt) You can run nested LLMs to execute tasks on other, smaller models. ```js // summarize each files individually for (const file of env.files) { const { text } = await runPrompt((_) => { _.def("FILE", file) _.$`Summarize the FILE.` }) def("FILE", { ...file, content: text }) } // summarize all summaries $`Summarize FILE.` ```

# Your first GenAI script

> Learn how to create and execute your initial GenAI script to automate interactions with language models.

GenAIScript use stylized JavaScript with minimal syntax. They are stored as JavaScript files (`genaisrc/*.genai.mjs)` or TypeScript files (`genaisrc/*.genai.mts`) in your project. The execution of a genaiscript creates the prompt that will be sent to the LLM. 1. * Visual Studio Code, Cursor Use the `> GenAIScript: Create new script...` command in the [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette) (`Ctrl+Shift+P` on Windows/Linux, `⇧⌘P` on Mac) to create a new script. ![A search bar with the text "createn" entered, displaying a suggestion for "GenAIScript: Create new script..." in a dropdown menu.](/genaiscript/_astro/vscode-create-new-script.Bia2CKYb_ZCe3CB.webp) * Other Editors Run the [cli](/genaiscript/reference/cli/) `script create` command with the name of the script you want to create. ```bash npx genaiscript script create proofreader ``` 2. The resulting file will be placed in the `genaisrc` folder in your project. * … * … ## the Prompt [Section titled “the Prompt”](#the-prompt) The execution of the GenAIScript generates a prompt (and more) that gets sent to the LLM model. The ` $``...`` ` template string function formats and write the string to the prompt; which gets sent to the LLM. poem.genai.mts ```js $`Write a one sentence poem.` ``` ## the Context [Section titled “the Context”](#the-context) GenAIScript exposes the context through the `env` variable. The context is implicitly defined by the location you start executing the script. * you can right click on a folder and the `env.files` will contain all the files nested in that folder. * you can right click on or in a file and the `env.files` will contain only that file. * you can run the script using the [command line interface](/genaiscript/reference/cli) and specify content of `env.files` in the CLI arguments. proofreader.genai.mts ```js def("FILES", env.files) ``` ## the Task [Section titled “the Task”](#the-task) The `$` function is used to build the prompt text, it renders and writes the text to the prompt (`$` is a [template literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)). proofreader.genai.mts ```js def("FILES", env.files) $`You are an expert technical writer and proofreader. Review the documents in FILE and report the 2 most important issues.` ``` ## the Metadata [Section titled “the Metadata”](#the-metadata) You can add a call to the `script` function to provides metadata about the script and the model. The metadata is used to display the script in the UI and configure the LLM model. proofreader.genai.mts ```js // the metadata script({ // user interface title: "Technical proofreading", description: "Reviews the text as a tech writer.", group: "documentation", // model configuration model: "large", temperature: 0, }) def("FILES", env.files) $`You are an expert technical writer and proofreader. Review the documents in FILE and report the 2 most important issues.` ``` The `title`, `description`, and `group` properties are used to display the script in the UI and can be helpful when the user is searching for a script. ![A screenshot of a text editor showing a task labeled "Technical proofreading" with the description "Reviews the text as a tech writer." A hyperlink labeled "documentation" is on the right.](/genaiscript/_astro/vscode-select-script.CsuuFbnn_Z1O5H97.webp) ## Next steps [Section titled “Next steps”](#next-steps) * Follow the [Prompt As Code guide](/genaiscript/guides/prompt-as-code) to dive deeper in programmatically generating prompts * [Run your script](/genaiscript/getting-started/running-scripts) from Visual Studio Code.
