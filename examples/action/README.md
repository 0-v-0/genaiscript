  github_token: ${{ ... }}
  debug: ${{ ... }}
```

## Example

```yaml
name: Run action-poem Action
on:
    workflow_dispatch:
    push:

    group: action-poem-${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}

      - name: Run action-poem Action
        uses: action-poem-action@main
        with:
          github_token: ${{ ... }}
          debug: ${{ ... }}
```

## Development

This action was automatically generated by GenAIScript from the script metadata.
We recommend updating the script metadata instead of editing the action files directly.

- the action inputs are inferred from the script parameters
- the action outputs are inferred from the script output schema
- the action description is the script title
- the readme description is the script description
- the action branding is the script branding

To **regenerate** the action files (`action.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `README.md`, `package.json`, `.gitignore`), run:

```bash
npm run configure
```

> [!CAUTION]
> This will overwrite any changes you made to these files!

To lint script files, run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

To typecheck the scripts, run:
```bash
npm run typecheck
```

To build the Docker image locally, run:
```bash
npm run docker:build
```

To run the action locally in Docker (build it first), use:
```bash
npm run docker:start
```
