From the [GitHub Next blog](https://githubnext.com/projects/continuous-ai/):

> **Continuous AI** is a label we've identified for all uses of automated AI to support software collaboration on any platform. Any use of automated AI to support any software collaboration on any platform anywhere is Continuous AI.

> We've chosen the term "Continuous AI” to align with the established concept of Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). Just as CI/CD transformed software development by automating integration and deployment, Continuous AI covers the ways in which AI can be used to automate and enhance collaboration workflows.

> “Continuous AI” is not a term GitHub owns, nor a technology GitHub builds: it's a term we use to focus our minds, and which we're introducing to the industry. This means Continuous AI is an open-ended set of activities, workloads, examples, recipes, technologies and capabilities; a category, rather than any single tool.
