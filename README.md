# GenAIScript - Generative AI Scripting

[GenAIScript](https://aka.ms/genaiscript) (formerly GPTools, CoArch) allows teams, including non-developers, to create and use GenAI-enhanced scripts. GenAIScript uses LLMs to enable a new kind of scripting that combines traditional code and natural language.

```js
script({ title: "Code XRay" })

def("FILE", env.files.filter(f => !f.filename.endsWith(".xray")))

$`You are an expert at programming in all known languages.
For each FILE, extract the code structure
that ignores the internal details of the implementation.'
```
