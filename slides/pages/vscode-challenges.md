# VSCode Extensions

Hard/unsolved limitations encountered.

- dynamic imports not supported
  - _not every dependency can be bundled_ (pdfjs-dist)
- process execution cross-platform hard
  - run process, read exit code, stdout, stderr
  - bash vs powershell vs zsh vs ...
- `languageModel` proposal (yes!)
- chat participants initially investigated but not a good fit
