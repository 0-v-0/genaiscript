![The image contains a graphic with text and logos. In the center, there is bold text that reads "Plain Ordinary Software (POSW)" with the acronym "POSW" emphasized. Surrounding this text is a circular arrangement of various tech company logos, partially visible and faded in the background. Below the central text, there is another line of text that says "Software before Foundation Models (FMs)" which seems to suggest a comparison or evolution in software development stages. The overall design suggests a focus on traditional software in contrast to newer foundation models.](/posw.png)

![The image features a large blue circle with text inside it that reads "AI Software (AISW)" with a brain-like icon in the center, representing artificial intelligence. Above the circle, the text says "In 10 years," suggesting a future perspective on AI software. Below the circle, there are additional details that are partially obscured, but visible text includes "GitHub Copilot, etc.," referring to an example of AI software, and "Software that uses FMs at runtime," which seems to indicate a technical aspect of how the software operates. There are also icons at the bottom, likely representing different technologies or platforms associated with AI software, but the specific logos are not clearly identifiable.](/aisw-p10.png)
