![The image is a flowchart depicting the process of a system using plugins and a language learning model (LLM) to generate a final answer. The process begins with initialization and proceeds through various steps where the LLM picks a plugin, runs the plugin with inputs such as web, emails, etc., and then processes the result. This cycle can repeat as needed before the system generates the final answer. The flowchart includes several labeled elements such as "Plugin List," "User Prompt," "System Prompt," "Training Data," "Exec," "Result," and "Analyze." These elements are connected by arrows indicating the flow of information and decision-making through the system. The flowchart is organized into rows labeled "External," "Plugin," "Copilot," and "LLM," which represent different levels or components of the system.](/plug-in.png)

`The diagram illustrates the process flow of an AI system in charge of invoking software (SW), highlighting the key difference that AI is responsible for initiating the software. The process is broken down into several stages: Initialization, Run plugin, Process result, Repeat, and Generate final answer.`

`During Initialization, the Language Learning Model (LLM) selects a plugin from a list. This list, along with user prompts and system prompts, is informed by training data, which is represented by a striped rectangle.`

`In the Run plugin phase, ...`
