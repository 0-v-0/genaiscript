![The image contains a graphic with text and logos. In the center, there is bold text that reads "Plain Ordinary Software (POSW)" with the acronym "POSW" emphasized. Surrounding this text is a circular arrangement of various tech company logos, partially visible and faded in the background. Below the central text, there is another line of text that says "Software before Foundation Models (FMs)" which seems to suggest a comparison or evolution in software development stages. The overall design suggests a focus on traditional software in contrast to newer foundation models.](/posw.png)

![The image is a graphic illustration presenting information about Artificial Intelligence (AI) software. At the top, the word "Today" appears, indicating a current context. The central feature is a large blue circle with a symbol that combines a brain and a gear, representing AI, and the text "AI Software (AISW)" inside it. Below the circle, there's a list labeled "Examples" that includes "GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT plugins, M365 Copilot, etc." Accompanying the text are icons representing GitHub (a stylized cat in a square), Microsoft (a slanted window symbol), and a generic AI symbol (stylized as a brain within a hexagon). At the bottom, there's a phrase "Software that uses FMs at runtime," suggesting that the software uses some form of functional modules or frameworks during operation. The graphic is designed to convey the idea of current AI software and some examples of it.](/aisw.png)
