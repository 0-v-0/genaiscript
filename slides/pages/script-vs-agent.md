# GenAIScript and Agents
&nbsp;
### GenAIScript is not an AI agent framework 
- Examples of agent frameworks: AutoGen, AutoGPT, etc
&nbsp;
### Major differences
- GenAIScript has a **static** orchestration graph
    - You know  when the LLM is called and with what arguments
- GenAIScript does not assume that the LLM will decompose
the task, relies on the user more
- GenAIScript applies LLMs in a **targeted** way, 
embedding the results into existing automation
&nbsp;
### Agent frameworks are an important research area
