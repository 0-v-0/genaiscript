![The image depicts two vertical block diagrams side by side, representing two different system stacks labeled "System Stack 1.0" and "System Stack 2.0".

On the left, "System Stack 1.0" consists of four layers in orange, from top to bottom: "POSW Application", "Language/runtime: (e.g., C#/CLR)", "OS", and "Hardware". Below the stack, "HW ISA" is written, connecting to the Hardware layer with a horizontal line.

On the right, "System Stack 2.0" includes four layers in green, from top to bottom: "AISW Application", "AI Language/Runtime (e.g., GenAIScript)", "AI Controller (AICl)", and "LLM Inference Engine". Below this stack, "AI ISA" is written, connecting to the LLM Inference Engine layer with a horizontal line.

The image is used to compare the traditional software stack with a new, AI-focused stack, highlighting the different components at each layer of the system architecture.](/system-stack-2.png)
