# Dev Experience

## VSCode - Fast feedback loop.

- Run: command from file/folder/editor
- Debugger: launch script through CLI
- Trace: document provider + markdown preview
- Authentication: from `.env` or `vscode.languageModel` (proposed API)
- "Un-bundleable" code outsourced to server script.

# CLI - Automate

- npm package
- GitHub Action friendly

```
npx genaiscript run [script] [...files]
```
