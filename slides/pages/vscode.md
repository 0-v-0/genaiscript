# VSCode integration

Short dev cycles, fast feedback loop.

- Run: Context command from file/folder/editor and infer context

- Debugger: launch script through CLI

- Trace: document provider + markdown preview

- Authentication: from `.env` or `vscode.languageModel` (proposed API)

- "Un-bundleable" code outsourced to server script.
