Ethan: Welcome to our demonstration of GPTools, a powerful framework that empowers teams to create and use AI-enhanced scripts for their workflows.

Nancy: That's right, Ethan. GPTools leverages foundation models to enable a new kind of scripting that combines traditional code and natural language.

Ethan: In this demo, we'll see how a user can create a function that validates email addresses using natural language. They start by clicking on the gpspec file and writing the task to be done.

Nancy: Once the task is written, the user selects the code generation gptool. GPTools are JavaScript files that process the context and text generation instruction to create a prompt.

Ethan: The generation of results is streamed to VSCode, and the results are parsed into a refactoring workspace edit, which the user can review.

Nancy: This seamless integration with VSCode makes it easy for users, even non-developers, to automate their workflows in ways that were previously impossible.

Ethan: Absolutely, Nancy. GPTools is a game-changer for teams working with complex artifacts, enabling them to create, understand, and maintain their projects more efficiently.
