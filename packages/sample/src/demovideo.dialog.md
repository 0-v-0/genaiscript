Ethan: Welcome to our demo of GPTools, a powerful software tool for code generation.

Nancy: That's right, Ethan. In this demo, we'll see how a user can create a function to validate email addresses using natural language.

Ethan: The user starts by clicking on the gpspec file and writing the task they want to accomplish.

Nancy: Then, they select the code generation GPTool, which processes the context and text generation instructions to create a prompt.

Ethan: As the results are generated, they're streamed to Visual Studio Code, where the user can review them in a refactoring workspace edit.

Nancy: It's an efficient and user-friendly way to generate code, making developers' lives easier.
