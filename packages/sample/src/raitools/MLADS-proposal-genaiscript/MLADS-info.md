For the June 2024 Machine Learning, AI & Data Science Conference, we're going to try a different structure for the event. We want to share that structure and our current planning here along with some context and explanation. Of course, the event is just taking shape, so some things will likely change over the next few months as we run the call for content, the AI space rapidly evolves around us, and as we get feedback from the community. 

This post first outlines our planned structure for the event and then provides some context and explanations for why we're experimenting with this approach as a way of addressing the data gathered and feedback from the 2023 events. 

We have always followed the mantra of making each edition of MLADS familiar yet different, and iterating to try to find the best match with what the audience wants. We hope that you all engage with the June 2024 event in that spirit! 

June 2024 MLADS Conference Structure 

June 10: GenAI Summit

A short series of online-only talks (likely delivered through Teams Town Halls) that focus on Microsoft's strategy and delivery of generative AI products and services.
The sessions and speakers for these sessions will be recruited by the conference and will feature leaders in the GenAI space here at Microsoft. 

June 11: MLADS Conference Day 1

An online-only day featuring multiple concurrent tracks of talks and tutorials delivered through Teams meetings.
Focusing on generative AI, generally at the 200/300 level.
Sourced from the MLADS Call for Content.
This online-only day will feel similar to the online-only conferences we held in 2020 and 2021.
The June 10 content will be recruited directly by the conference, while the June 11-13 content will come from the call for content.
Selections will be made based on the results of the peer reviewing. 

June 12: MLADS Conference Day 2

An online only day featuring multiple concurrent tracks of talks and tutorials delivered through Teams meetings.
Covering any aspect of machine learning, AI, or data science, generally at the 200/300 level.
Sourced from the MLADS Call for Content.
This online-only day also will feel similar to the 2020 and 2021 editions of the event.
On both June 11 and 12 we hope to schedule sessions during work hours outside the North American time zones. 

June 13: MLADS Conference Day 3

An in-person-only day in Redmond in the new building 7.
Sessions this day will not be streamed or recorded because they will be experiences best had in-person.
Sessions will include things like meetups, panel discussions, roundtables, Ask the Experts, birds-of-a-feather discussions, and possibly hands-on labs.
We'd also like to do a Meet the Speakers networking event, where speakers based in Redmond who presented online on June 11 or 12 come in to meet people in person.
We'd also like to do a Poster Gallery with in-person presentations.
For those unable to attend in-person, which we acknowledge is a significant portion of our overall audience, we will provide support and suggestions for gathering on your own at Garage locations or other venues where you are located.
 
Context and Explanations

 After running MLADS Conferences with hybrid sessions in 2022 and 2023, we're trying a different approach in 2024. The event itself will be hybrid, but the sessions will be either online-only or in-person-only. We're experimenting with this for a few reasons:
 
At each MLADS in 2023, we had about 4,000 attendees, of whom about 3,500-3,600 attended solely online. At each event we had about 200-300 people who attended both online and in-person. And only about 200 people who attended solely in-person. With 400-500 people passing through the Conference Center over two full days, the result was that the rooms at the conference center were sometimes sparsely occupied, because 90% or so of the audience for any given session was made up of online viewers. 

Fun Fact 1: Among the MLADS registrants, 36% work in the Pacific time zone (so perhaps 30% or so are based in Redmond, where the conference is held).

We want to continue to offer a strong set of content optimized for online viewers, that anyone can access from their location.

2. Hybrid sessions are difficult to run smoothly, as speakers and session chairs must track in-person and online questions and interactions. MLADS is a community-driven event, and we do not want to put too much load on our volunteers. We think that holding events either online or in-person will make it easier for volunteer session chairs to manage the sessions.

3. We will continue to post recordings for sessions within a few hours of the session happening. We know that online viewers do not generally sit down to watch several hours of online sessions at once, but often set aside other time to watch recordings. We want to make it possible for you to do this as soon as possible after a session ends.

4. From the survey verbatims, we can see that those who do show up in person wish there were more happening in-person to encourage networking and connection. However, we also heard that it is hard to devote two full days to the conference. Given this feedback, we are trying to concentrate all of the in-person activity into one day, to maximize the number of attendees in one place at one time, and to make it more possible for those attending in person to set aside one full day for in-person attendance.

We do know that only having one day of in-person activity likely makes it much less attractive for people to travel in from out of town. This is a downside of the planned structure, but we hope that if people do travel from out of town, having one very full in-person day at MLADS will be more attractive than the less concentrated experiences in 2022 and 2023, and that these folks can pair their visits with other networking and connections they do outside of the conference itself.

Fun Fact 2: The top 3 reasons that online-only viewers chose to attend online-only were (1) travel distance to the conference site in Redmond, (2) the flexibility in attending online, and (3) lack of budget to travel to the event in person -- we think it's likely that budget restrictions on travel will continue in 2024.
 
5. While the Microsoft Conference Center has served MLADS well over the past decade, given the number of people attending in person in 2022 and 2023, we are moving the in-person portion of the event to Building 7, where the rooms are smaller, and thus more right-sized for sessions with several dozen people attending (rather than hundreds). Building 7 also offers many casual seating options and food options, so for those that do travel to the event, it will be easy to stay in Building 7 all day.

6. There is a tremendous focus at Microsoft on generative AI, and with that energy, we plan to keep a large portion of the June 2024 event focused on generative AI. However, at the December 2023 event, the audience clearly told us that they wanted an event that covered a broader scope -- 82% of survey respondents answered that they wanted a broader scope, while only 12% wanted the event to stay focused only on foundation models and generative AI (the rest expressed no preference).

So, as a result, we welcome proposals covering any aspect of ML, AI, and data science for this event, but you can still expect strong coverage of generative AI.

7. The majority of the content at the event will be pitched at the 200/300 level. We may have some 100-level content, but in contrast with a decade ago, when the conference started, there is now a tremendous amount of 100-level content for AI, ML, and data science being offered within Microsoft and beyond. Rather than adding to that collection, we think that the unique value of MLADS comes from the more advanced sharing of the learning and insights of AI and ML practitioners as they put their work into production and in front of Microsoft customers (either directly, or through partners).

8. We will be limiting the number of concurrent tracks of online talks to 4, or perhaps 5 on occasion. In 2023, we sometimes had up to 10 concurrent tracks (5-6 being offered hybrid from the conference center, and 3-4 being offered online-only). While limiting the number of tracks may reduce the total amount of coverage at the event, we want to make it less likely that people have to choose between two sessions they want to attend. We are planning to "stretch" the days so that we are offering some content appropriate for the workday outside of Redmond. Our experiments with this in the AI & ML Community Calls in the past few months show that we really should be offering more time-zone appropriate content at the MLADS Conference. We plan to do this, but we may have to lean on our community to help out here.

We have always approached MLADS as a community-driven event, as seen by the hundreds of presenters and volunteers that contribute into the event every edition. By publishing this blog, we hope to practice "working out loud" by sharing with you the approach for the June 2024 MLADS and the reasons behind this approach.

As always, we welcome your input and feedback, and if you are interested in volunteering for the event, please contact DSMLEVNT, and we will get back with you.


Thank you for participating in MLADS!
