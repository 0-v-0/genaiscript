deadline is May 11, the paper submission deadline is May 17, and the
supplementary material deadline is May 24. We need to open source the
training code, the trained model, and the dataset by July 15."

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known limitations

**4.2** Reflecting on your data (see 3.2 above) and your techniques,
what are the current limitations of the system? This could include
scenarios where the system will not perform well (e.g., a language
system being use in a natural language that is not supported, or an
image generation tool what works better for scenery then for images of
humans), environmental factors to consider (lighting for images, or
background noise for audio recordings), or other factors to be aware of.

  Known limitations
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

could happen? What are the most obvious abuse scenarios? What could go
wrong? Will anyone be hurt? In what ways?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Abuse risks
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

**4.4** Is it possible for your assets to be misused unintentionally?
For example, by a non-familiar or novice user or used in an operational
environment that the system was not designed for? What could go wrong?
Will anyone be hurt? In what ways?

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Unintended use risks
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Mitigations for immediate risks

**4.5** Check all mitigations you intend to use for risks identified and
add any additional mitigations in the box provided.

Limiting open release:

> ☐ Not releasing code/models/data
>
> ☐ Providing a mitigated demonstration web site in lieu of releasing
> high risk models/code/data publicly
>
> ☐ Leveraging a process similar to the [ACM artifact evaluation
> process](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/sigcomm/2021/cf-artifacts.html)
> -- i.e., providing code/models/data specifically to reviewers without
> public release
>
> ☐ Gating the public release through an email/form to the team

Monitor use for abuse:

> ☐ Releasing in such a way that usage can be tracked
>
> ☐ Actively setting up alerts and escalations when abusive patterns are
> discovered

Clear and complete transparency documentation:

> ☐ Ethics and Responsible AI statements in paper
>
> ☐ Model card
>
> ☐ Transparency note
>
> ☐ RAI section in product documentation
>
> ☐ RAI information in blogs and other messaging (please describe):
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
>
> ☐ Any limitation of release should clearly state the RAI reasoning for
> not sharing the technology openly
>
> ☐ Clearly communicates the intention of use only in research settings
>
> ☐ Content moderation (please describe):
> \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
