## Notes for the content
**Pay attention to these comments about what reviewers will be looking for in the proposal**

Starting from explaining the problem the project addresses, down into more details about what it does and a bit about how it works. Also, consider explaining terms that are central to understanding this project.

I think the audience will also want to know if this is ready to use, or a tool under development. Who is the intended audience and what do you hope they will do as a result of learning about this? 
 
In Methods, the (human) reviewers will similarly look for a bit more detail about how this works and how it was tested.
