# Writing an Impact Assessment

## What is an Impact Assessment?
An Impact Assessment is the core tool in the RAI Standard used to guide teams through considering their stakeholders, impacts and mitigations. The “tool” itself is a word template. 

It is meant to be completed by a cross discipline team in order to get diverse viewpoints.

## Getting started
Start by reading the Generative AI Guidance (was LLM Guidance) if you're doing anything generative. You can find a comprehensive breakdown of known harms/impacts and appropriate mitigations. This can be really helpful if you're new to doing a comprehensive impact assessment. You can copy any applicable harms and mitigations into your impact assessment. 

## How to complete the Impact Assessment 
1. Choose the template that best suits your project.
- If you're releasing a research asset, consider using the research impact assessment template.
- If you're working on a project that has clear user scenarios or you're on a product trajectory, use the corporate impact assessment template. Use the corporate impact assessment for LMM/MMM if you're using generative AI.
2. Download a copy of the template and complete it. Refer to the resources below for more information.
3. Paste a link to your draft impact assessment stored in a shared location in the message board if you'd like feedback from your RAI SME.
4. Upload your final copy and check off the task.
5. Pay it forward!
- Add a link to your final impact assessment in the comments below so people can learn from you.
- Suggest edits or enhancements to the templates to make things easier for your peers.
- Offer to review your colleagues' impact assessments.
- Suggest improvements to process, tools, etc. - TnR_Rai@microsoft.com.

## Tips
- Include the link to the any R&CT records associated with this project.
- Include links to supporting documents such as specs, papers, overview decks, etc.
- Use clear, simple language to describe your technology and scenario.
- Avoid using technical language from a paper. The easier it is for the reviewers to understand the project, the quicker they can provide feedback.
- Make sure to highlight any potential harms that you have considered or are aware of.
- Fully document all the ways that your technology could be misused or abused.
- Do not document the “happy path” only. This shows that you’re cognizant of potential misuse and allows you to consider mitigations.
- List all mitigations you have already implemented or are considering.
- If you are drafting transparency language for a readme, model card, or other documentation, link to your draft text in the impact assessment.
