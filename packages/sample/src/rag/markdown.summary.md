This file is about Markdown, a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber in 2004, used for adding formatting elements to plain text documents. It contrasts with WYSIWYG editors as it requires syntax like number signs for headings and asterisks for bold text, offering a different experience from immediate visual formatting. The text also mentions that Markdown files can be edited in applications like Visual Studio Code.
