Markdown is a lightweight markup language used for adding formatting elements to plain text documents. Created by John Gruber in 2004, it has become one of the most popular markup languages. Unlike WYSIWYG editors such as Microsoft Word, where formatting changes are made through button clicks, Markdown requires the user to add syntax to indicate formatting. For example, a heading is denoted by a number sign (e.g., # Heading One), and bold text is surrounded by two asterisks (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take some time to adapt to using Markdown syntax, especially for those used to WYSIWYG applications.
