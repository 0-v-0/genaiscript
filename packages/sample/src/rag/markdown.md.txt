Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber in 2004 that allows users to add formatting elements to plain text documents. Unlike WYSIWYG editors, where formatting changes are visible immediately through button clicks, Markdown requires users to apply syntax to text to indicate formatting. For example, a heading is indicated with a number sign (e.g., # Heading One), and bold text is created with two asterisks (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may take some time to adapt to this syntax for those familiar with WYSIWYG applications.
