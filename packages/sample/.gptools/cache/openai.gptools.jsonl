The framework leverages foundation models (specifically LLMs) to enable a new kind of scripting that combines traditional code and natural language.\n\n> Don't forget to turn on the sound.\n\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/gptools/assets/4175913/74517b81-4b9c-47d9-8a5c-a15362b0d4db\n\n## Key Objectives and Technical Elements\n\nThe main objectives of gptools are to improve automation, collaboration, and accessibility in the creation, understanding, and maintenance of complex GPT artifacts.\nThe key elements of the gptools framework are:\n\n-   [gptools](./docs/gptools.md): Scripts that integrate traditional code and natural language, leveraging foundation models in their execution.\n-   [gpspecs](./docs/gpspecs.md): Natural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context.\n-   [VS Code extension](./packages/vscode/README.md): Supporting seamless user interaction with gptools.\n-   **gpvm**: A framework and runtime system that executes gpspecs and gptools.\n\nGPTools access AI foundation models (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Llama, ...) using a [user-provided token](./docs/token.md).\n\n## Install manually\n\nThese are the instructions to install the latest build of the extension manually in Visual Studio Code.\n\n-   open the [latest release](https://github.com/microsoft/gptools/releases/latest/),\n-   download the `gptools.vsix` file\n-   open Visual Studio Code\n-   open the command palette and type **Extensions: Install from VSIX...**\n-   load the `gptools.vsix` file\n\nUntil this extension is in the Marketplace, you will have to repeat these steps each time you want to upgrade the extension.\n\n### GPTool scripts\n\nGPTool scripts use stylized JavaScript with minimal syntax. They are stored as files (`gptools/*.gptool.js`) in your project.\n\n```js\ngptool({\n    title: \"Technical proofreading\",\n    description: \"Reviews the text as a technical document writer.\",\n})\n\ndef(\"TEXT\", env.file)\n\n$`You are reviewing and updating TEXT to fix grammatical errors, fix spelling errors and make it technical.`\n```\n\nGPTools comes with builtin tools and allows you to fork and customize the AI prompts to your project specific needs.\nThis leverages VSCode language support (completion, coloring, error checking)\nwhile remaining friendly to people not very familiar with JavaScript.\nGPTools also provides detailed expansion logs to help you debug your templates.\n\nSince gptool scripts are stored as files in the project, they can be shared, versioned, collaborated on by the entire development team\nusing the existing team development cycle.\n\nIn the future, we foresee that developers will create libraries of gptools and share them as libraries on their favorite package manager.\n\n-   [Read more about gptools](./docs/gptools.md).\n\n## GPSpec specifications\n\nNatural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context. GPTools parses `*.gpspec.md` markdown files as specification.\n\n```markdown A sample GPSpec document.\n# email address recognizer\n\nWrite a function that takes a string argument\nand returns true if the whole string is a valid email address, false otherwise.\n```\n\n-   [Read more about gpspecs](./docs/gpspecs.md).\n\n## User experience\n\nThis diagram demonstrates the AI-enhanced workflow process in gptools.

Maximum 3 bullet points.\n-  Use mermaid syntax if you need to generate state diagrams, class inheritance diagrams, relationships.\n-  If the source is code, describe the code and show the code in a separate slide.\n-  Keep code snippet short. Maximum 10 lines. Maximum 42 columns. Use multiple slides if needed. Ellipse sections with ... if necessary.\n-  The first slide have a title and a summary of the slidedeck.\n-  Ignore Contributing, Copyright and Trademarks sections.\n\n"}]},"val":"File ./README.md.slides.md:\n`````\n### GPTools - AI-Enhanced Workflows for Teams\n\n- GPTools allows teams to create and use AI-enhanced scripts.\n- The framework leverages LLMs to combine traditional code and natural language.\n\n---\n\n### Key Objectives and Technical Elements\n\n- Improve automation, collaboration, and accessibility in GPT artifacts.\n- Key elements: gptools, gpspecs, VS Code extension, gpvm.\n\n---\n\n### GPTool Scripts\n\n- GPTool scripts use stylized JavaScript with minimal syntax.\n- Stored as files (`gptools/*.gptool.js`) in your project.\n\n---\n\n### GPTool Script Example\n\n```js\ngptool({\n    title: \"Technical proofreading\",\n    description: \"Reviews the text as a tech writer.\",\n})\n\ndef(\"TEXT\", env.file)\n\n$`You are reviewing and updating TEXT \nto fix grammatical errors, \nfix spelling errors and make it technical.`\n```\n\n---\n\n### GPSpec Specifications\n\n- Natural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context.\n- GPTools parses `*.gpspec.md` markdown files as specification.\n\n---\n\n### GPSpec Example\n\n```markdown\n# email address recognizer\n\nWrite a function that takes a string\nand returns true if the whole string is a valid email address,\nfalse otherwise.\n```\n\n---\n\n### User Experience\n\n- The gpspec starts the `gptool`, which reads the `gpspec`, interacts with the gpvm and foundation model.\n- The AI-generated output is used to update the workspace.\n\n---\n\n### User Experience Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\nparticipant User\nparticipant VSCode\nparticipant gpspec\nparticipant gptool\nparticipant gpvm\nUser->>VSCode: Create/Edit gpspec\nVSCode->>gpspec: Save gpspec\nUser->>VSCode: Invoke gptool\nVSCode->>gptool: Execute gptool with gpspec + workspace\ngptool->>gpvm: Request foundation model execution\ngpvm->>gptool: Return AI-generated output\ngptool->>VSCode: Update workspace with output\nVSCode->>User: Display updated workspace\n```\n\n---\n\n### Getting Started\n\n- Install in Visual Studio Code.\n- Try a builtin tool.\n- Create a gpspec.\n- Fork a tool.\n`````\n\nSUMMARY:\n```\nConverted README.md to a slidedeck in markdown format in README.md.slides.md.\n```"}
