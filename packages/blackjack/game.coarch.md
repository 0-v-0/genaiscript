# Description Create a command line blackjack application 

## Idea

Create a command line application that allows users to play blackjack with it. It should allow the user to place a bet, be dealt multiple hands, and finally quit. Implement the blackjack dealer by always standing on 17 and above and drawing on anything less. The program should handle how much money the player has and print out the actions of the dealer and how much money the player has after each round.
