## Known issues
- The values of the ace and face cards should be printed as "ace, king, queen, jack" instead of "1, 13, 12, 11" and the suit printed.
- WHen printed, all the cards should include the suit of the card as well as the value.
- Show the players hand after the cards are dealt.
- Show the each new card the player draws.
- Show the dealers visible cards when they are dealt.
- Show the dealers cards and the player's cards at the end.
- The dealer wins when there is a tie.

## Idea

Create a command line application that allows users to play blackjack with it. It should allow the user to place a bet, be dealt multiple hands, and finally quit. Implement the blackjack dealer by always standing on 17 and above and drawing on anything less. The program should handle how much money the player has and print out the actions of the dealer and how much money the player has after each round.
