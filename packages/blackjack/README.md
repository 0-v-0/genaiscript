# Exploring CoArch with the Blackjack Sample

## Prompts

There are 4 general prompts in this directory that are intended to reflect 4 personas associated with software development.  These prompts appear in the "appdev" folder of the prompts menu.

- **PM-planning.prompt.js** - This prompt takes a project description in a .coarch.md file (a paragraph describing the application), and expands the contents of that file to include specific instructions for the software architect, the software developer, and the quality assurance engineer on how to implement the project.
- **SA-planning.js** - This prompt takes the contents of the planning file generated by the PM-planning prompt (blackjack.coarch.md) and generates a new CoArch file (blackjack.saplan.coarch.md) with detailed instructions for the software developer.  It expands the general guidance to include specific aspects of the appliction, including what files it should contain and how they interact.
- **SDE-Coding** - This prompt takes a detailed explanation of the application, including descriptions of the files and the interfaces between them, and generates Python code to implement the application.
- **QA-coding.js** - This prompt takes the contents of the blackjack.saplan.coarch.md, and generates a set of test files that test the components of the application as specified by the architect.

# Workflow

We start the workflow from a simple heading and short description. In this example, we are building a command line blackjack game but the prompts are general and can work for other applications as well.  Here is the starting point for the blackjack application.

```
# Description Create a command line blackjack application 

Idea: Create a command line application that allows users to play blackjack with it. It should allow the user to place a bet, be dealt multiple hands, and finally quit. Implement the blackjack dealer by always standing on 17 and above and drawing on anything less. The program should handle how much money the player has and print out the actions of the dealer and how much money the player has after each round.
```

Generation steps:
1. Place the description above in ```game.coarch.md```
2. Run the PM-planning prompt over the file to expand the description.
3. Run the SA-planning prompt over the same file to generate the file ```game.saplanning.coarch.md```
4. Run the SDE-planning prompt over the saplanning file to generate a set of Python files that implement the application.
5. Test the application, edit the files as needed, and rerun the prompts as needed.
6. QA-coding is not yet implemented.
