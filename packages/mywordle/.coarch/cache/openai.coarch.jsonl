The rules follow the rules of the popular game. The game picks a random hidden 5-letter word from a dictionary of legal words. The user provides a 5-letter word and the game shows the user which of the letters in their word is (1) in the hidden word and (2) whether that letter is in the correct position. The user then offers another 5-letter word. If the users' word is an illegal word, the game should tell the user it is illegal, give no feedback except to request another word until they type a legal word. They have a total of 6 guesses. Illegal guess don't count against their total. If they guess the hidden word they win. If they lose, the game should show them the hidden word. The game should use graphical elements similar to the Web-based version to show which of their letters was in the hidden word or in the correct location. After each turn the user feedback should include exactly what letters are correct and if letters appear in the correct position, it should say what position they are in. The game should also print out the hidden word at the end when the user quits.\n\n## Directions for the Software Developer\n\nUse the SUMMARY as input and generate the architecture for the product. Encapsulate each component in a separate module and define the APIs for each component. Make sure that the components are loosely coupled, they can be easily tested and that the APIs are well defined. Don't write the code yourself but provide a clear and complete explanation of what each component should do and what the API is that a software developer can implement the code for each component and that a quality assurance engineer can write test cases from your descriptions.\n\n## Programming Language and Framework\n\nWe will use Python as the programming language and no specific framework is required for this command line application.\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n- wordle/\n  - main.py\n  - wordle_game.py\n  - word_dictionary.py\n  - user_interface.py\n\n## Invariants\n\n1. The hidden word should always be a 5-letter legal word.\n2. The user's guess should be a 5-letter word.\n3. The user has a maximum of 6 legal guesses.\n\n## Components\n\n### main.py\n\nThis is the entry point of the application. It imports the `WordleGame` class from `wordle_game.py` and the `UserInterface` class from `user_interface.py`. It initializes the game and user interface instances and starts the game loop.\n\n### wordle_game.py\n\nThis file contains the `WordleGame` class, which handles the game logic. It imports the `WordDictionary` class from `word_dictionary.py`.\n\n**API:**\n\n- `__init__(self)`: Initializes the game state, including the hidden word and the number of guesses.\n- `guess_word(self, word: str) -> Tuple[str, List[Tuple[int, str]]]`: Takes the user's guess and returns the result of the guess, including the correct letters and their positions.\n- `is_legal_word(self, word: str) -> bool`: Checks if the given word is a legal word.\n- `is_game_over(self) -> bool`: Checks if the game is over (either the user has won or has used all their guesses).\n- `get_hidden_word(self) -> str`: Returns the hidden word.\n\n### word_dictionary.py\n\nThis file contains the `WordDictionary` class, which manages the dictionary of legal words.\n\n**API:**\n\n- `__init__(self)`: Initializes the dictionary by loading the legal words from a file.\n- `get_random_word(self) -> str`: Returns a random 5-letter legal word.\n- `is_legal_word(self, word: str) -> bool`: Checks if the given word is a legal word.\n\n### user_interface.py\n\nThis file contains the `UserInterface` class, which handles user input and output.\n\n**API:**\n\n- `get_user_guess(self) -> str`: Gets the user's guess from the command line.\n- `display_guess_result(self, result: Tuple[str, List[Tuple[int, str]]])`: Displays the result of the user's guess.\n- `display_game_over(self, hidden_word: str, has_won: bool)`: Displays the game over message, including the hidden word and whether the user has won or lost.\n\n## Command Line Client\n\nThe command line client will be the `main.py` file. To start the game, the user can run `python main.py` from the command line. The user interface will guide the user through the game, including inputting their guesses and displaying the results.\n\n### updates.md\n\nReport a summary of changes made to the files in this file.\n|||\n\nCODE:\n|||\n|||\n\nDOCS:\n|||\n#  MyWordle Application Description\n\n-   [PM-planning](./mywordle.pm.coarch.md)\n\n## Idea\nThis application implements Wordle as a command line application.

If the users' word is an illegal word, the game should tell the user it is illegal, give no feedback except to request another word until they type a legal word. They have a total of 6 guesses. Illegal guess don't count against their total. If they guess the hidden word they win. If they lose, the game should show them the hidden word. The game should use graphical elements similar to the Web-based version to show which of their letters was in the hidden word or in the correct location. After each turn the user feedback should include exactly what letters are correct and if letters appear in the correct position, it should say what position they are in. The game should also print out the hidden word at the end when the user quits.\n\n## Directions for the Software Developer\n\nUse the SUMMARY as input and generate the architecture for the product. Encapsulate each component in a separate module and define the APIs for each component. Make sure that the components are loosely coupled, they can be easily tested and that the APIs are well defined. Don't write the code yourself but provide a clear and complete explanation of what each component should do and what the API is that a software developer can implement the code for each component and that a quality assurance engineer can write test cases from your descriptions.\n\n## Programming Language and Framework\n\nWe will use Python as the programming language and no specific framework is required for this command line application.\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n- wordle/\n  - main.py\n  - wordle_game.py\n  - word_dictionary.py\n  - user_interface.py\n\n## Invariants\n\n1. The hidden word should always be a 5-letter legal word.\n2. The user's guess should be a 5-letter word.\n3. The user has a maximum of 6 legal guesses.\n\n## Components\n\n### main.py\n\nThis is the entry point of the application. It imports the `WordleGame` class from `wordle_game.py` and the `UserInterface` class from `user_interface.py`. It initializes the game and user interface instances and starts the game loop.\n\n### wordle_game.py\n\nThis file contains the `WordleGame` class, which handles the game logic. It imports the `WordDictionary` class from `word_dictionary.py`.\n\n**API:**\n\n- `__init__(self)`: Initializes the game state, including the hidden word and the number of guesses.\n- `guess_word(self, word: str) -> Tuple[str, List[Tuple[int, str]]]`: Takes the user's guess and returns the result of the guess, including the correct letters and their positions.\n- `is_legal_word(self, word: str) -> bool`: Checks if the given word is a legal word.\n- `is_game_over(self) -> bool`: Checks if the game is over (either the user has won or has used all their guesses).\n- `get_hidden_word(self) -> str`: Returns the hidden word.\n\n### word_dictionary.py\n\nThis file contains the `WordDictionary` class, which manages the dictionary of legal words.\n\n**API:**\n\n- `__init__(self)`: Initializes the dictionary by loading the legal words from a file.\n- `get_random_word(self) -> str`: Returns a random 5-letter legal word.\n- `is_legal_word(self, word: str) -> bool`: Checks if the given word is a legal word.\n\n### user_interface.py\n\nThis file contains the `UserInterface` class, which handles user input and output.\n\n**API:**\n\n- `get_user_guess(self) -> str`: Gets the user's guess from the command line.\n- `display_guess_result(self, result: Tuple[str, List[Tuple[int, str]]])`: Displays the result of the user's guess.\n- `display_game_over(self, hidden_word: str, has_won: bool)`: Displays the game over message, including the hidden word and whether the user has won or lost.\n\n## Command Line Client\n\nThe command line client will be the `main.py` file. To start the game, the user can run `python main.py` from the command line. The user interface will guide the user through the game, including inputting their guesses and displaying the results.\n\n### updates.md\n\nReport a summary of changes made to the files in this file.\n|||\n\nCODE:\n|||\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\nclass UserInterface:\n    def get_user_guess(self) -> str:\n        return input(\"Enter a 5-letter word: \").strip()\n\n    def display_guess_result(self, result: Tuple[str, List[Tuple[int, str]]]):\n        print(result[0])\n        for pos, letter in result[1]:\n            print(f\"Letter {letter} is in position {pos + 1}.\")\n\n    def display_game_over(self, hidden_word: str, has_won: bool):\n        if has_won:\n            print(\"Congratulations!

The rules follow the rules of the popular game. The game picks a random hidden 5-letter word from a dictionary of legal words. The user provides a 5-letter word and the game shows the user which of the letters in their word is (1) in the hidden word and (2) whether that letter is in the correct position. The user then offers another 5-letter word. \nIf the users' word is an illegal word, the game should tell the user it is illegal, give no feedback except to\nrequest another word until they type a legal word.\nThey have a total of 6 guesses. Illegal guess don't count against their total.\nIf they guess the hidden word they win. If they lose, the game should show them the hidden word. The game should use graphical elements similar to the Web-based version to show which of their letters was in the hidden word or in the correct location.\nAfter each turn the user feedback should include exactly what letters are correct and if letters appear in the correct position, \nit should say what position they are in.  The game should also print out the hidden word at the end when the user quits.\n\n# Notes on bugs in the code\n\nGenerate all permutations.\n|||\n\nBUGS:\n|||\n# Notes on bugs in the code\n\nGenerate all permutations.\n|||\n\nUse documentation from DOCS.  \n\n\nYou are an expert software developer with years of experience implementing Python applications.\nYou always write syntactically correct code that is easy to read and understand. \n \nThe resulting CODE should be complete.  \nDo not leave any incomplete content as a work item todo in a comment.\nDo not generate comments of the form \"Implement xxxx here\" or \"Implement xxxx later\".\n\nA software architect has specified the architecture for a new product \nand has defined the APIs for each component in SUMMARY.   \nCODE contains the code for the product generated from a previous SUMMARY.\n\nIssues with the current implementation have been described in BUGS.\n\nYour job is to make a minimum of updates to CODE to match any changes that have \nmade to SUMMARY and to address any issues mentioned in BUGS.\n\nFor each of the Python files listed in SUMMARY, CODE contains the code for\nthe component which is in a separate file using the file name used in SUMMARY.\n\nUpdate the only the CODE for files mentioned in SUMMARY that require changes to \naddress any updates to SUMMARY or any issues mentioned in BUGS.\n\nMake sure that the code is well documented and that the code is easy to read and understand.\nMake sure that the comments follow the Python commenting conventions.\nMake sure that the code follows all the APIs specified in SUMMARY.\nMake sure that the code is modular and that a quality assurance engineer can \nwrite test cases for each component.\nMake sure that you can run the client component on the command line for demonstration and testing purposes.\nInclude assertions in your code to ensure that the code is correct.\n\nIt is very important that when generating multiple files, do not use triple backquote to separate the files.\nNever use triple backquotes to separate files in the generated code.\n\nRespond only with the new CODE.\nDo not provide any other output.\nLimit changes to existing code to minimum.\nAlways ensure that code you generate is well-formed Python code that can be run.  \n\n"}]},"val":"File src/main.py:\n|||\nimport sys\nfrom wordle_game import WordleGame\nfrom user_interface import UserInterface\n\ndef main():\n    game = WordleGame()\n    ui = UserInterface()\n\n    while not game.is_game_over():\n        guess = ui.get_user_guess()\n\n        if not game.is_legal_word(guess):\n            print(\"Illegal word.
