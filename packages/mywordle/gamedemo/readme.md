# Example of working application generated from CoArch prompts

The files in this directory implement a working version of MyWordle that was created by the process described.  The files were generated using the prompts in the CoArch project.  After observing bugs in the original version, the bugs were documented in the ```bugnotes.md``` file and the ```SDE-update``` prompt was run to update the implementation files to fix the bugs.
