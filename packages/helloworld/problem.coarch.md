# email address recognizer

Write a function that takes a string argument and returns true if the whole string is a valid email address, false otherwise.

-   [email_address_recognizer.py](email_address_recognizer.py)

## Code Review

1. The code is concise and easy to understand.
2. The regular expression pattern used is appropriate for most email addresses.
3. The function name `is_valid_email` is descriptive and follows Python naming conventions.
4. The code uses type hints for better readability and understanding of the function's input and output.

However, there are a few improvements that can be made:

1. The regular expression pattern can be improved to handle more edge cases and special characters.
2. The `re.match()` function can be replaced with `re.fullmatch()` to ensure the entire string is matched, not just the beginning.
3. Add comments to explain the regular expression pattern for better maintainability.

Suggested changes:

1. Update the regular expression pattern to: `r'^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&â€™*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$'`
2. Replace `re.match()` with `re.fullmatch()`.
3. Add a comment explaining the regular expression pattern.
