# gptools: AI-Enhanced Tools for Human Workflows

gptools is a framework designed to empower teams, including non-developers, to use AI-enhanced scripts in their efforts to create, understand, and maintain complex artifacts. It leverages foundation models (LLMs) to enable a new kind of scripting that combines traditional code and natural language for greater functionality and ease of use.

## Key Components

- **gptools**: Scripts that integrate traditional code and natural language, utilizing foundation models in their execution.
- **gpspecs**: Natural language documents that instantiate gptools in a specific context.
- **gpvm**: A framework and runtime system that executes gpspecs and gptools.
- **gptools extension to VS code**: Provides seamless user interaction with gptools.

## The Heilmeier Catechism

1. **What are you trying to do?** We aim to empower teams with AI-enhanced tools that support the creation, understanding, and maintenance of complex artifacts, making it accessible to both developers and non-developers.

2. **How is it done today, and what are the limitations of the current practice?** Currently, software development involves manual processes and various tools. AI models have the potential to automate complex workflows, but they have limitations, such as making mistakes and lacking transparency.

3. **What is new in your approach, and why do you think it will be successful?** Our approach combines traditional code and natural language in gptools, making it easier for non-developers to use and understand. By separating gptools and gpspecs, we enable modularity, reuse, and independent maintenance.

4. **Who cares?** Developers, non-developers, and organizations that want to leverage AI-enhanced tools to improve their workflows and automate tasks that were previously impossible.

5. **If you are successful, what difference will it make?** It will transform the way AI-enhanced applications are developed and used, enabling non-developers to automate their workflows and fostering a new generation of AI-enhanced applications.

6. **What are the risks and payoffs?** Risks include potential mistakes made by AI models and the challenge of understanding their decision-making process. The payoff is the democratization of AI-enhanced tools, enabling a wider range of users to benefit from their capabilities.

7. **How much will it cost?** The cost will depend on the development and maintenance of the gptools framework, runtime system, and VS code extension. It will also depend on the AI models used and the resources required for their execution.

8. **How long will it take?** The timeline will depend on the complexity of the gptools, gpspecs, and the integration with foundation models. It will also depend on the adoption and customization of gptools by various users and organizations.

9. **What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success?** Midterm exams include the successful development and integration of gptools, gpspecs, and the VS code extension. Final exams involve widespread adoption, customization, and the creation of AI-enhanced applications across various verticals.
