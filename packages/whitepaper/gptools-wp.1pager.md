# gptools: AI-Enhanced Workflows for Complex Artifacts

gptools is a framework designed to empower teams, including non-developers, to use AI-enhanced scripts to support their efforts in creating, understanding, and maintaining complex artifacts. It leverages foundation models (LLMs) to enable a new kind of scripting that combines traditional code and natural language. The key elements of gptools include:

- _gptools_: Scripts that integrate traditional code and natural language, leveraging foundation models in their execution.
- _gpspecs_: Natural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context.
- _gpvm_: A framework and runtime system that executes gpspecs and gptools.
- _gptools extension to VS code_: Supporting seamless user interaction with gptools.

## The Heilmeier Catechism

1. **What are you trying to do?**

   Empower teams to use AI-enhanced scripts for creating, understanding, and maintaining complex artifacts, making it accessible to non-developers.

2. **How is it done today, and what are the limitations of the current practice?**

   Software development is a complex, manual process with various tools and abstractions. AI models can perform tasks that traditional software cannot, but they have limitations, such as making mistakes and lacking transparency.

3. **What is new in your approach, and why do you think it will be successful?**

   gptools combines traditional code and natural language, leveraging foundation models to create a new kind of scripting. Separating gptools from gpspecs allows for modularity, reuse, and easier understanding by non-developers.

4. **Who cares?**

   Developers, non-developers, and organizations looking to automate workflows and improve collaboration in creating and maintaining complex artifacts.

5. **If you are successful, what difference will it make?**

   gptools will fuel a new generation of AI-enhanced applications, empowering non-developers to automate workflows and customize tools for their needs.

6. **What are the risks and the payoffs?**

   Risks include AI models making mistakes and lacking transparency. Payoffs include increased automation, collaboration, and accessibility of complex workflows for non-developers.

7. **How much will it cost?**

   The cost will depend on the implementation, maintenance, and usage of gptools, as well as the AI models and resources required.

8. **How long will it take?**

   The timeline will depend on the development, testing, and deployment of gptools and its components.

9. **What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success?**

   Midterm exams include successful implementation of gptools and its components, and user adoption. Final exams include widespread usage, improved workflows, and increased collaboration between developers and non-developers.
