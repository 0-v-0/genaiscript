CoArch is a groundbreaking project designed to revolutionize the way humans and Large Language Models (LLMs) collaborate in creating and maintaining complex artifacts, such as software projects and documentation. By integrating a programming language framework and user interface into Visual Studio Code, CoArch enables seamless creation, evolution, and maintenance of these artifacts while ensuring consistency across components. This innovative approach overcomes the limitations of traditional chat interfaces by offering a more modular, abstract, and reusable system for coordinating AI-generated content, ultimately streamlining the development process and unlocking new AI use scenarios.

The primary goals of CoArch are to provide first-class support for human-AI collaboration and to promote the use of CoArch prompts as highly-tuned, first-class software artifacts that can be edited, reviewed, shared, and customized by a team with a wide range of skills. By leveraging CoArch's advanced features, such as abstraction, modularity, explicit dependencies, and hierarchical decomposition, developers, technical writers, and teams working on complex artifacts can experience enhanced collaboration and improved consistency across components. As CoArch continues to evolve and integrate with other experiences, its potential for widespread impact and the ability to support new AI use scenarios make it a game-changer in the realm of human-AI collaboration.
