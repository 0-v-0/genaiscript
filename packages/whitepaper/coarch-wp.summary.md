CoArch is an innovative project designed to enhance the collaboration between humans and Large Language Models (LLMs) in building and maintaining complex artifacts, such as software projects and documentation. It is a programming language framework and user interface integrated into Visual Studio Code, enabling the creation, evolution, and maintenance of complex artifacts while ensuring consistency across components. CoArch aims to provide first-class support for human-AI collaboration and promote the use of CoArch prompts as highly-tuned, first-class software artifacts that can be edited, reviewed, shared, and customized by a team with a wide range of skills.

1. What is new and innovative about the project?

CoArch introduces a new approach to human-AI collaboration by providing a framework for defining, connecting, and applying related prompts. It goes beyond traditional chat interfaces by offering a more modular, abstract, and reusable system for coordinating AI-generated content. CoArch supports hierarchical decomposition, allowing users to break down tasks into subtasks and build refinement trees. It also enables new human-AI interactions and experiences, making it easier for users to customize prompts for specific tasks and teams.

2. The Heilmeier Catechism:

- What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
  CoArch aims to improve human-AI collaboration in creating and maintaining complex artifacts, such as software projects and documentation, by providing a framework for managing and applying AI-generated content.

- How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
  Today, AI collaboration is primarily done through chat interfaces, which are linear and lack modularity, abstraction, and reusability. These interfaces do not scale well and are not integrated into the artifacts they help create.

- What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
  CoArch introduces a new approach by providing a framework for defining, connecting, and applying related prompts in a hierarchical and modular manner. This approach allows for better organization, customization, and collaboration, making it more likely to succeed in complex projects.

- Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?
  Developers, technical writers, and teams working on complex artifacts will benefit from CoArch's improved human-AI collaboration capabilities. It will streamline the creation and maintenance of artifacts, ensuring consistency and enabling new AI use scenarios.

- What are the risks and the payoffs?
  The risks include potential difficulties in defining the abstraction boundaries with prompts and ensuring bidirectional consistency automatically. The payoffs include enhanced collaboration, improved consistency across components, and the ability to leverage AI capabilities in new and innovative ways.

- How much will it cost?
  The cost of implementing CoArch will depend on the resources required for development, integration, and maintenance. However, the potential benefits of improved collaboration and efficiency could outweigh the costs.

- How long will it take?
  The timeline for implementing CoArch will depend on the scope of the project and the resources allocated to it. As CoArch is already integrated into Visual Studio Code, further development and refinement will depend on user feedback and the exploration of new features and generalizations.

- What are the midterm and final "exams" to check for success?
  Midterm exams could include successful integration into existing projects, user feedback, and the ability to handle complex artifacts with consistency. Final exams would involve widespread adoption, demonstrable improvements in collaboration and efficiency, and the ability to support new AI use scenarios.
