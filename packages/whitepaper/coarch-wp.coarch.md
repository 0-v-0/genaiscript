## Notes on the introduction

The introduction to the white paper should explain how CoArch is can be applied to the problem of software development specifically so that the concepts are concrete.

The introduction should also explain the key abstraction mechanisms of CoArch, and how they are used to create a coherent architecture.

Mention that the key abstraction elements in CoArch are the .coarch.md command files which capture the concrete intent and structure for a particular use case, and the .prompt.js files, which allow sharing and customization of general-purpose prompts.
