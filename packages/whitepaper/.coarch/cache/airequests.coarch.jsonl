We separate scripts into two related parts: a generic reuseable *gptool* and a natural language *gpspec* that instantiates the gptool in a particular context\n\nKey elements of gptools:\n- *gptools* – Scripts that integrate traditional code and natural language and leverage foundation models in their execution\n- *gpspecs* – Natural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context\n- *gpvm* – A framework and runtime system that executes gpspecs and gptools\n- *gptools extension to VS code* – supporting seamless user interaction with gptools\n\n## gptool: A New Kind of Script\n\n- A gptool is a script with the following components\n    - A header that contains metadata related to the execution of the script (e.g., information about what LLM model to use, etc.)\n    - A natural language prompt intended to be processed by a foundation model\n    - An environment context that augments the natural language with additional data/information\n    - Programming language constructs that are used to programmatically manipulate both inputs and outputs\n\n- Benefits of gptools\n    - By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow gptools to become highly engineering shared artifacts that form the basis of shared libraries.  \n    - A gptool can be used in many different contexts, and can be updated and maintained independently of the gpspecs that use it.\n    - By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow non-developers to use gptools without having to understand the details of how they work.\n    - At the same time, because a gptool contains a natural langauge prompt, it is easy for a non-developer to understand what the gptool does, and to modify it to suit their needs.\n\n## gpspec: Natural language to invoke a gptool\n\nJust as a chat enables a user to interact with an AI model, a gpspec is a natural language markdown document that defines a context in which to invoke a gptool.\n\nA gpspec is a standard markdown file with the following additional elements:\n- Links to context elements that define the context in which a particular gptool is to be invoked.  The gpspec defines all possible contexts where a particular gptool might only refer to some part.\n- Natural language describing the specific task to be performed as input to one or more gptools.  For example, the spec for code might contain directions on the desired code as well as information about tests to be performed.  Different gptools invoked from the gpspec file can be used to perform different tasks.\n\nNote that one use of a gpspec would be to invoke a gptool to create a new gpspec with further refinement.\n\n## gptools Extension to VS Code\n\nWe believe that human oversight of AI models is essential to their effective use.  To support this, we have created a VS Code extension that allows a user to interact with a gpspec and gptool in a natural way.\n\nThe extension provides the following capabilities:\n- A command palette that allows a user to select a gptool to invoke in the context of a given gpspec file\n- A token management system that supports connecting with the AI model of interest\n- A runtime environment that:\n    - Captures the context defined by the gpspec\n    - Expands the gptool in the appropriate context\n    - Executes whatever code is present in the gptool\n    - Sends the results to the AI model\n    - Processes the results on return to update the user context (which might include updating files, etc.)\n- A user interface that allows the user to interact with the AI model to refine the results\n- An gptool trace viewing mechanism that allows users to understand how the AI model was used to generate the results\n\n## Implications of gptools\n\nThe existence of powerful programming tools based on AI that are usable by non-developers is transformative.\n\nJust as the development of JavaScript enabled Web 2.0 and python enabled the creation of the current AI software ecosystem, gptools will fuel a new generation of AI-enhanced applications.\n\nWe envision the creation of gptools for many different verticals, with opportunities for customization and authoring at many levels of expertise:\n- Professional developers and architects will define collections of gptools for a given vertical\n- Professional developers can author and maintain individual gptools just as packages are authored and maintained today\n- Developers and non-developers can customize gptools for their particular organization or application needs\n- Non-developers can author and maintain gpspecs for their particular projects\n\nFurthermore, the existence of gptools can empower non-developers to automate their workflows in ways that were previously impossible. \n`````\n\nYou are an expert Technical documentation reviewer and you will\ncreate a list of comments about the document FILE.

The gpspec defines all possible contexts where a particular gptool might only refer to some part.\n- Natural language describing the specific task to be performed as input to one or more gptools.  For example, the spec for code might contain directions on the desired code as well as information about tests to be performed.  Different gptools invoked from the gpspec file can be used to perform different tasks.\n\nNote that one use of a gpspec would be to invoke a gptool to create a new gpspec with further refinement.\n\n## gptools Extension to VS Code\n\nWe believe that human oversight of AI models is essential to their effective use.  To support this, we have created a VS Code extension that allows a user to interact with a gpspec and gptool in a natural way.\n\nThe extension provides the following capabilities:\n- A command palette that allows a user to select a gptool to invoke in the context of a given gpspec file\n- A token management system that supports connecting with the AI model of interest\n- A runtime environment that:\n    - Captures the context defined by the gpspec\n    - Expands the gptool in the appropriate context\n    - Executes whatever code is present in the gptool\n    - Sends the results to the AI model\n    - Processes the results on return to update the user context (which might include updating files, etc.)\n- A user interface that allows the user to interact with the AI model to refine the results\n- An gptool trace viewing mechanism that allows users to understand how the AI model was used to generate the results\n\n## Implications of gptools\n\nThe existence of powerful programming tools based on AI that are usable by non-developers is transformative.\n\nJust as the development of JavaScript enabled Web 2.0 and python enabled the creation of the current AI software ecosystem, gptools will fuel a new generation of AI-enhanced applications.\n\nWe envision the creation of gptools for many different verticals, with opportunities for customization and authoring at many levels of expertise:\n- Professional developers and architects will define collections of gptools for a given vertical\n- Professional developers can author and maintain individual gptools just as packages are authored and maintained today\n- Developers and non-developers can customize gptools for their particular organization or application needs\n- Non-developers can author and maintain gpspecs for their particular projects\n\nFurthermore, the existence of gptools can empower non-developers to automate their workflows in ways that were previously impossible. \n`````\n\nYou are an expert Technical documentation reviewer and you will\ncreate a list of comments about the document FILE.

We separate scripts into two related parts: a generic reuseable *gptool* and a natural language *gpspec* that instantiates the gptool in a particular context\n\nKey elements of gptools:\n- *gptools* – Scripts that integrate traditional code and natural language and leverage foundation models in their execution\n- *gpspecs* – Natural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context\n- *gpvm* – A framework and runtime system that executes gpspecs and gptools\n- *gptools extension to VS code* – supporting seamless user interaction with gptools\n\n## gptool: A New Kind of Script\n\n- A gptool is a script with the following components\n    - A header that contains metadata related to the execution of the script (e.g., information about what LLM model to use, etc.)\n    - A natural language prompt intended to be processed by a foundation model\n    - An environment context that augments the natural language with additional data/information\n    - Programming language constructs that are used to programmatically manipulate both inputs and outputs\n\n- Benefits of gptools\n    - By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow gptools to become highly engineering shared artifacts that form the basis of shared libraries.  \n    - A gptool can be used in many different contexts, and can be updated and maintained independently of the gpspecs that use it.\n    - By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow non-developers to use gptools without having to understand the details of how they work.\n    - At the same time, because a gptool contains a natural langauge prompt, it is easy for a non-developer to understand what the gptool does, and to modify it to suit their needs.\n\n## gpspec: Natural language to invoke a gptool\n\nJust as a chat enables a user to interact with an AI model, a gpspec is a natural language markdown document that defines a context in which to invoke a gptool.\n\nA gpspec is a standard markdown file with the following additional elements:\n- Links to context elements that define the context in which a particular gptool is to be invoked.  The gpspec defines all possible contexts where a particular gptool might only refer to some part.\n- Natural language describing the specific task to be performed as input to one or more gptools.  For example, the spec for code might contain directions on the desired code as well as information about tests to be performed.  Different gptools invoked from the gpspec file can be used to perform different tasks.\n\nNote that one use of a gpspec would be to invoke a gptool to create a new gpspec with further refinement.\n\n## gptools Extension to VS Code\n\nWe believe that human oversight of AI models is essential to their effective use.  To support this, we have created a VS Code extension that allows a user to interact with a gpspec and gptool in a natural way.\n\nThe extension provides the following capabilities:\n- A command palette that allows a user to select a gptool to invoke in the context of a given gpspec file\n- A token management system that supports connecting with the AI model of interest\n- A runtime environment that:\n    - Captures the context defined by the gpspec\n    - Expands the gptool in the appropriate context\n    - Executes whatever code is present in the gptool\n    - Sends the results to the AI model\n    - Processes the results on return to update the user context (which might include updating files, etc.)\n- A user interface that allows the user to interact with the AI model to refine the results\n- An gptool trace viewing mechanism that allows users to understand how the AI model was used to generate the results\n\n## Implications of gptools\n\nThe existence of powerful programming tools based on AI that are usable by non-developers is transformative.\n\nJust as the development of JavaScript enabled Web 2.0 and python enabled the creation of the current AI software ecosystem, gptools will fuel a new generation of AI-enhanced applications.\n\nWe envision the creation of gptools for many different verticals, with opportunities for customization and authoring at many levels of expertise:\n- Professional developers and architects will define collections of gptools for a given vertical\n- Professional developers can author and maintain individual gptools just as packages are authored and maintained today\n- Developers and non-developers can customize gptools for their particular organization or application needs\n- Non-developers can author and maintain gpspecs for their particular projects\n\nFurthermore, the existence of gptools can empower non-developers to automate their workflows in ways that were previously impossible. \n`````\n\nYou are an expert Technical documentation reviewer and you will\ncreate a list of comments about the document FILE.

We separate scripts into two related parts: a generic reuseable *gptool* and a natural language *gpspec* that instantiates the gptool in a particular context\n\nKey elements of gptools:\n- *gptools* – Scripts that integrate traditional code and natural language and leverage foundation models in their execution\n- *gpspecs* – Natural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context\n- *gpvm* – A framework and runtime system that executes gpspecs and gptools\n- *gptools extension to VS code* – supporting seamless user interaction with gptools\n\n## gptool: A New Kind of Script\n\n- A gptool is a script with the following components\n    - A header that contains metadata related to the execution of the script (e.g., information about what LLM model to use, etc.)\n    - A natural language prompt intended to be processed by a foundation model\n    - An environment context that augments the natural language with additional data/information\n    - Programming language constructs that are used to programmatically manipulate both inputs and outputs\n\n- Benefits of gptools\n    - By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow gptools to become highly engineering shared artifacts that form the basis of shared libraries.  \n    - A gptool can be used in many different contexts, and can be updated and maintained independently of the gpspecs that use it.\n    - By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow non-developers to use gptools without having to understand the details of how they work.\n    - At the same time, because a gptool contains a natural langauge prompt, it is easy for a non-developer to understand what the gptool does, and to modify it to suit their needs.\n\n## gpspec: Natural language to invoke a gptool\n\nJust as a chat enables a user to interact with an AI model, a gpspec is a natural language markdown document that defines a context in which to invoke a gptool.\n\nA gpspec is a standard markdown file with the following additional elements:\n- Links to context elements that define the context in which a particular gptool is to be invoked.  The gpspec defines all possible contexts where a particular gptool might only refer to some part.\n- Natural language describing the specific task to be performed as input to one or more gptools.  For example, the spec for code might contain directions on the desired code as well as information about tests to be performed.  Different gptools invoked from the gpspec file can be used to perform different tasks.\n\nNote that one use of a gpspec would be to invoke a gptool to create a new gpspec with further refinement.\n\n## gptools Extension to VS Code\n\nWe believe that human oversight of AI models is essential to their effective use.  To support this, we have created a VS Code extension that allows a user to interact with a gpspec and gptool in a natural way.\n\nThe extension provides the following capabilities:\n- A command palette that allows a user to select a gptool to invoke in the context of a given gpspec file\n- A token management system that supports connecting with the AI model of interest\n- A runtime environment that:\n    - Captures the context defined by the gpspec\n    - Expands the gptool in the appropriate context\n    - Executes whatever code is present in the gptool\n    - Sends the results to the AI model\n    - Processes the results on return to update the user context (which might include updating files, etc.)\n- A user interface that allows the user to interact with the AI model to refine the results\n- An gptool trace viewing mechanism that allows users to understand how the AI model was used to generate the results\n\n## Implications of gptools\n\nThe existence of powerful programming tools based on AI that are usable by non-developers is transformative.\n\nJust as the development of JavaScript enabled Web 2.0 and python enabled the creation of the current AI software ecosystem, gptools will fuel a new generation of AI-enhanced applications.\n\nWe envision the creation of gptools for many different verticals, with opportunities for customization and authoring at many levels of expertise:\n- Professional developers and architects will define collections of gptools for a given vertical\n- Professional developers can author and maintain individual gptools just as packages are authored and maintained today\n- Developers and non-developers can customize gptools for their particular organization or application needs\n- Non-developers can author and maintain gpspecs for their particular projects\n\nFurthermore, the existence of gptools can empower non-developers to automate their workflows in ways that were previously impossible. \n`````\n\nYou are an expert Technical documentation reviewer and you will\ncreate a list of comments about the document FILE.

We separate scripts into two related parts: a generic reuseable *gptool* and a natural language *gpspec* that instantiates the gptool in a particular context\n\nKey elements of gptools:\n- *gptools* – Scripts that integrate traditional code and natural language and leverage foundation models in their execution\n- *gpspecs* – Natural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context\n- *gpvm* – A framework and runtime system that executes gpspecs and gptools\n- *gptools extension to VS code* – supporting seamless user interaction with gptools\n\n## gptool: A New Kind of Script\n\n- A gptool is a script with the following components\n    - A header that contains metadata related to the execution of the script (e.g., information about what LLM model to use, etc.)\n    - A natural language prompt intended to be processed by a foundation model\n    - An environment context that augments the natural language with additional data/information\n    - Programming language constructs that are used to programmatically manipulate both inputs and outputs\n\n- Benefits of gptools\n    - By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow gptools to become highly engineered shared artifacts that form the basis of shared libraries.  \n    - A gptool can be used in many different contexts, and can be updated and maintained independently of the gpspecs that use it.\n    - By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow non-developers to use gptools without having to understand the details of how they work.\n    - At the same time, because a gptool contains a natural language prompt, it is easy for a non-developer to understand what the gptool does, and to modify it to suit their needs.\n\n## gpspec: Natural language to invoke a gptool\n\nJust as a chat enables a user to interact with an AI model, a gpspec is a natural language markdown document that defines a context in which to invoke a gptool.\n\nA gpspec is a standard markdown file, with the following additional elements:\n- Links to context elements that define the context in which a particular gptool is to be invoked.  The gpspec defines all possible contexts where a particular gptool might only refer to some part.\n- Natural language describing the specific task to be performed as input to one or more gptools.  For example, the spec for code might contain directions on the desired code as well as information about tests to be performed.  Different gptools invoked from the gpspec file can be used to perform different tasks.\n\nNote that one use of a gpspec would be to invoke a gptool to create a new gpspec with further refinement.\n\n## gptools Extension to VS Code\n\nWe believe that human oversight of AI models is essential to their effective use.  To support this, we have created a VS Code extension that allows a user to interact with a gpspec and gptool in a natural way.\n\nThe extension provides the following capabilities:\n- A command palette that allows a user to select a gptool to invoke in the context of a given gpspec file\n- A token management system that supports connecting with the AI model of interest\n- A runtime environment that:\n    - Captures the context defined by the gpspec\n    - Expands the gptool in the appropriate context\n    - Executes whatever code is present in the gptool\n    - Sends the results to the AI model\n    - Processes the results on return to update the user context (which might include updating files, etc.)\n- A user interface that allows the user to interact with the AI model to refine the results\n- A gptool trace viewing mechanism that allows users to understand how the AI model was used to generate the results\n\n## Implications of gptools\n\nThe existence of powerful programming tools based on AI that are usable by non-developers is transformative.\n\nJust as the development of JavaScript enabled Web 2.0 and python enabled the creation of the current AI software ecosystem, gptools will fuel a new generation of AI-enhanced applications.\n\nWe envision the creation of gptools for many different verticals, with opportunities for customization and authoring at many levels of expertise:\n- Professional developers and architects will define collections of gptools for a given vertical\n- Professional developers can author and maintain individual gptools just as packages are authored and maintained today\n- Developers and non-developers can customize gptools for their particular organization or application needs\n- Non-developers can author and maintain gpspecs for their particular projects\n\nFurthermore, the existence of gptools can empower non-developers to automate their workflows in ways that were previously impossible. \n`````\n\nYou are an expert Technical documentation reviewer and you will\ncreate a list of comments about the document FILE.
