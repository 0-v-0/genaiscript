We separate scripts into two related parts: a generic reuseable *gptool* and a natural language *gpspec* that instantiates the gptool in a particular context\n\nKey elements of gptools:\n- *gptools* – Scripts that integrate traditional code and natural language and leverage foundation models in their execution\n- *gpspecs* – Natural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context\n- *gpvm* – A framework and runtime system that executes gpspecs and gptools\n- *gptools extension to VS code* – supporting seamless user interaction with gptools\n\n## gptool: A New Kind of Script\n\n- A gptool is a script with the following components\n    - A header that contains metadata related to the execution of the script (e.g., information about what LLM model to use, etc.)\n    - A natural language prompt intended to be processed by a foundation model\n    - An environment context that augments the natural language with additional data/information\n    - Programming language constructs that are used to programmatically manipulate both inputs and outputs\n\n- Benefits of gptools\n    - By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow gptools to become highly engineering shared artifacts that form the basis of shared libraries.  \n    - A gptool can be used in many different contexts, and can be updated and maintained independently of the gpspecs that use it.\n    - By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow non-developers to use gptools without having to understand the details of how they work.\n    - At the same time, because a gptool contains a natural langauge prompt, it is easy for a non-developer to understand what the gptool does, and to modify it to suit their needs.\n\n## gpspec: Natural language to invoke a gptool\n\nJust as a chat enables a user to interact with an AI model, a gpspec is a natural language markdown document that defines a context in which to invoke a gptool.\n\nA gpspec is a standard markdown file with the following additional elements:\n- Links to context elements that define the context in which a particular gptool is to be invoked.  The gpspec defines all possible contexts where a particular gptool might only refer to some part.\n- Natural language describing the specific task to be performed as input to one or more gptools.  For example, the spec for code might contain directions on the desired code as well as information about tests to be performed.  Different gptools invoked from the gpspec file can be used to perform different tasks.\n\nNote that one use of a gpspec would be to invoke a gptool to create a new gpspec with further refinement.\n\n## gptools Extension to VS Code\n\nWe believe that human oversight of AI models is essential to their effective use.  To support this, we have created a VS Code extension that allows a user to interact with a gpspec and gptool in a natural way.\n\nThe extension provides the following capabilities:\n- A command palette that allows a user to select a gptool to invoke in the context of a given gpspec file\n- A token management system that supports connecting with the AI model of interest\n- A runtime environment that:\n    - Captures the context defined by the gpspec\n    - Expands the gptool in the appropriate context\n    - Executes whatever code is present in the gptool\n    - Sends the results to the AI model\n    - Processes the results on return to update the user context (which might include updating files, etc.)\n- A user interface that allows the user to interact with the AI model to refine the results\n- An gptool trace viewing mechanism that allows users to understand how the AI model was used to generate the results\n\n## Implications of gptools\n\nThe existence of powerful programming tools based on AI that are usable by non-developers is transformative.\n\nJust as the development of JavaScript enabled Web 2.0 and python enabled the creation of the current AI software ecosystem, gptools will fuel a new generation of AI-enhanced applications.\n\nWe envision the creation of gptools for many different verticals, with opportunities for customization and authoring at many levels of expertise:\n- Professional developers and architects will define collections of gptools for a given vertical\n- Professional developers can author and maintain individual gptools just as packages are authored and maintained today\n- Developers and non-developers can customize gptools for their particular organization or application needs\n- Non-developers can author and maintain gpspecs for their particular projects\n\nFurthermore, the existence of gptools can empower non-developers to automate their workflows in ways that were previously impossible. \n`````\n\nYou are an expert Technical documentation reviewer and you will\ncreate a list of comments about the document FILE.

We separate scripts into two related parts: a generic reuseable *gptool* and a natural language *gpspec* that instantiates the gptool in a particular context\n\nKey elements of gptools:\n- *gptools* – Scripts that integrate traditional code and natural language and leverage foundation models in their execution\n- *gpspecs* – Natural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context\n- *gpvm* – A framework and runtime system that executes gpspecs and gptools\n- *gptools extension to VS code* – supporting seamless user interaction with gptools\n\n## gptool: A New Kind of Script\n\n- A gptool is a script with the following components\n    - A header that contains metadata related to the execution of the script (e.g., information about what LLM model to use, etc.)\n    - A natural language prompt intended to be processed by a foundation model\n    - An environment context that augments the natural language with additional data/information\n    - Programming language constructs that are used to programmatically manipulate both inputs and outputs\n\n- Benefits of gptools\n    - By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow gptools to become highly engineering shared artifacts that form the basis of shared libraries.  \n    - A gptool can be used in many different contexts, and can be updated and maintained independently of the gpspecs that use it.\n    - By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow non-developers to use gptools without having to understand the details of how they work.\n    - At the same time, because a gptool contains a natural langauge prompt, it is easy for a non-developer to understand what the gptool does, and to modify it to suit their needs.\n\n## gpspec: Natural language to invoke a gptool\n\nJust as a chat enables a user to interact with an AI model, a gpspec is a natural language markdown document that defines a context in which to invoke a gptool.\n\nA gpspec is a standard markdown file with the following additional elements:\n- Links to context elements that define the context in which a particular gptool is to be invoked.  The gpspec defines all possible contexts where a particular gptool might only refer to some part.\n- Natural language describing the specific task to be performed as input to one or more gptools.  For example, the spec for code might contain directions on the desired code as well as information about tests to be performed.  Different gptools invoked from the gpspec file can be used to perform different tasks.\n\nNote that one use of a gpspec would be to invoke a gptool to create a new gpspec with further refinement.\n\n## gptools Extension to VS Code\n\nWe believe that human oversight of AI models is essential to their effective use.  To support this, we have created a VS Code extension that allows a user to interact with a gpspec and gptool in a natural way.\n\nThe extension provides the following capabilities:\n- A command palette that allows a user to select a gptool to invoke in the context of a given gpspec file\n- A token management system that supports connecting with the AI model of interest\n- A runtime environment that:\n    - Captures the context defined by the gpspec\n    - Expands the gptool in the appropriate context\n    - Executes whatever code is present in the gptool\n    - Sends the results to the AI model\n    - Processes the results on return to update the user context (which might include updating files, etc.)\n- A user interface that allows the user to interact with the AI model to refine the results\n- An gptool trace viewing mechanism that allows users to understand how the AI model was used to generate the results\n\n## Implications of gptools\n\nThe existence of powerful programming tools based on AI that are usable by non-developers is transformative.\n\nJust as the development of JavaScript enabled Web 2.0 and python enabled the creation of the current AI software ecosystem, gptools will fuel a new generation of AI-enhanced applications.\n\nWe envision the creation of gptools for many different verticals, with opportunities for customization and authoring at many levels of expertise:\n- Professional developers and architects will define collections of gptools for a given vertical\n- Professional developers can author and maintain individual gptools just as packages are authored and maintained today\n- Developers and non-developers can customize gptools for their particular organization or application needs\n- Non-developers can author and maintain gpspecs for their particular projects\n\nFurthermore, the existence of gptools can empower non-developers to automate their workflows in ways that were previously impossible. \n`````\n\nYou are an expert Technical documentation reviewer and you will\ncreate a list of comments about the document FILE.

We separate scripts into two related parts: a generic reuseable *gptool* and a natural language *gpspec* that instantiates the gptool in a particular context\n\nKey elements of gptools:\n- *gptools* – Scripts that integrate traditional code and natural language and leverage foundation models in their execution\n- *gpspecs* – Natural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context\n- *gpvm* – A framework and runtime system that executes gpspecs and gptools\n- *gptools extension to VS code* – supporting seamless user interaction with gptools\n\n## gptool: A New Kind of Script\n\n- A gptool is a script with the following components\n    - A header that contains metadata related to the execution of the script (e.g., information about what LLM model to use, etc.)\n    - A natural language prompt intended to be processed by a foundation model\n    - An environment context that augments the natural language with additional data/information\n    - Programming language constructs that are used to programmatically manipulate both inputs and outputs\n\n- Benefits of gptools\n    - By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow gptools to become highly engineered shared artifacts that form the basis of shared libraries.  \n    - A gptool can be used in many different contexts, and can be updated and maintained independently of the gpspecs that use it.\n    - By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow non-developers to use gptools without having to understand the details of how they work.\n    - At the same time, because a gptool contains a natural language prompt, it is easy for a non-developer to understand what the gptool does, and to modify it to suit their needs.\n\n## gpspec: Natural language to invoke a gptool\n\nJust as a chat enables a user to interact with an AI model, a gpspec is a natural language markdown document that defines a context in which to invoke a gptool.\n\nA gpspec is a standard markdown file, with the following additional elements:\n- Links to context elements that define the context in which a particular gptool is to be invoked.  The gpspec defines all possible contexts where a particular gptool might only refer to some part.\n- Natural language describing the specific task to be performed as input to one or more gptools.  For example, the spec for code might contain directions on the desired code as well as information about tests to be performed.  Different gptools invoked from the gpspec file can be used to perform different tasks.\n\nNote that one use of a gpspec would be to invoke a gptool to create a new gpspec with further refinement.\n\n## gptools Extension to VS Code\n\nWe believe that human oversight of AI models is essential to their effective use.  To support this, we have created a VS Code extension that allows a user to interact with a gpspec and gptool in a natural way.\n\nThe extension provides the following capabilities:\n- A command palette that allows a user to select a gptool to invoke in the context of a given gpspec file\n- A token management system that supports connecting with the AI model of interest\n- A runtime environment that:\n    - Captures the context defined by the gpspec\n    - Expands the gptool in the appropriate context\n    - Executes whatever code is present in the gptool\n    - Sends the results to the AI model\n    - Processes the results on return to update the user context (which might include updating files, etc.)\n- A user interface that allows the user to interact with the AI model to refine the results\n- A gptool trace viewing mechanism that allows users to understand how the AI model was used to generate the results\n\n## Implications of gptools\n\nThe existence of powerful programming tools based on AI that are usable by non-developers is transformative.\n\nJust as the development of JavaScript enabled Web 2.0 and python enabled the creation of the current AI software ecosystem, gptools will fuel a new generation of AI-enhanced applications.\n\nWe envision the creation of gptools for many different verticals, with opportunities for customization and authoring at many levels of expertise:\n- Professional developers and architects will define collections of gptools for a given vertical\n- Professional developers can author and maintain individual gptools just as packages are authored and maintained today\n- Developers and non-developers can customize gptools for their particular organization or application needs\n- Non-developers can author and maintain gpspecs for their particular projects\n\nFurthermore, the existence of gptools can empower non-developers to automate their workflows in ways that were previously impossible. \n`````\n\nYou are an expert Technical documentation reviewer and you will\ncreate a list of comments about the document FILE.

We separate scripts into two related parts: a generic reusable _gptool_ and a natural language _gpspec_ that instantiates the gptool in a particular context\n\nKey elements of gptools:\n\n-   _gptools_ – Scripts that integrate traditional code and natural language and leverage foundation models in their execution\n-   _gpspecs_ – Natural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context\n-   _gpvm_ – A framework and runtime system that executes gpspecs and gptools\n-   _gptools extension to VS code_ – supporting seamless user interaction with gptools\n\n## gptool: A New Kind of Script\n\n-   A gptool is a script with the following components\n\n    -   A header that contains metadata related to the execution of the script (e.g., information about what LLM model to use, etc.)\n    -   A natural language prompt intended to be processed by a foundation model\n    -   An environment context that augments the natural language with additional data/information\n    -   Programming language constructs that are used to programmatically manipulate both inputs and outputs\n\n-   Benefits of gptools\n    -   By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow gptools to become highly engineered shared artifacts, forming the basis of shared libraries.\n    -   A gptool can be used in many different contexts, and can be updated and maintained independently of the gpspecs that use it.\n    -   By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow non-developers to use gptools without having to understand the details of how they work.\n    -   At the same time, because a gptool contains a natural language prompt, it is easy for a non-developer to understand what the gptool does, and to modify it to suit their needs.\n\n## gpspec: Natural language to invoke a gptool\n\nJust as a chat enables a user to interact with an AI model, a gpspec is a natural language markdown document that defines a context in which to invoke a gptool.\n\nA gpspec is a standard markdown file, with the following additional elements:\n\n-   Links to context elements that define the context in which a particular gptool is to be invoked. The gpspec defines all possible contexts where a particular gptool might only refer to some part.\n-   Natural language describing the specific task to be performed as input to one or more gptools. For example, the spec for code might contain directions on the desired code as well as information about tests to be performed. Different gptools invoked from the gpspec file can be used to perform different tasks.\n\nNote that one possible use of a gpspec is to invoke a gptool, which in turn creates a new gpspec with further refinement.\n\n## gptools Extension to VS Code\n\nWe believe that human oversight of AI models is essential to their effective use. To support this, we have created a VS Code extension that allows a user to interact with a gpspec and gptool in a natural way.\n\nThe extension provides the following capabilities:\n\n-   A command palette that allows a user to select a gptool to invoke in the context of a given gpspec file\n-   A token management system that supports connecting with the AI model of interest\n-   A runtime environment that:\n    -   Captures the context defined by the gpspec\n    -   Expands the gptool in the appropriate context\n    -   Executes whatever code is present in the gptool\n    -   Sends the results to the AI model\n    -   Processes the results on return to update the user context (which might include updating files, etc.)\n-   A user interface that allows the user to interact with the AI model to refine the results\n-   A gptool trace viewing mechanism that allows users to understand how the AI model was used to generate the results\n\n## Implications of gptools\n\nThe existence of powerful programming tools based on AI that are usable by non-developers is transformative.\n\nJust as the development of JavaScript enabled Web 2.0, and python enabled the creation of the current AI software ecosystem, gptools will fuel a new generation of AI-enhanced applications.\n\nWe envision the creation of gptools for many different verticals, with opportunities for customization and authoring at many levels of expertise:\n\n-   Professional developers and architects will define collections of gptools for a given vertical\n-   Professional developers can author and maintain individual gptools just as packages are authored and maintained today\n-   Developers and non-developers can customize gptools for their particular organization or application needs\n-   Non-developers can author and maintain gpspecs for their particular projects\n\nFurthermore, the existence of gptools can empower non-developers to automate their workflows in ways that were previously impossible.\n`````\n\nYou are an expert Technical documentation reviewer and you will\ncreate a list of comments about the document FILE.

We separate scripts into two related parts: a generic reusable _gptool_ and a natural language _gpspec_ that instantiates the gptool in a particular context\r\n\r\nKey elements of gptools:\r\n\r\n-   _gptools_ – Scripts that integrate traditional code and natural language and leverage foundation models in their execution\r\n-   _gpspecs_ – Natural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context\r\n-   _gpvm_ – A framework and runtime system that executes gpspecs and gptools\r\n-   _gptools extension to VS code_ – supporting seamless user interaction with gptools\r\n\r\n## gptool: A New Kind of Script\r\n\r\n-   A gptool is a script with the following components\r\n\r\n    -   A header that contains metadata related to the execution of the script (e.g., information about what LLM model to use, etc.)\r\n    -   A natural language prompt intended to be processed by a foundation model\r\n    -   An environment context that augments the natural language with additional data/information\r\n    -   Programming language constructs that are used to programmatically manipulate both inputs and outputs\r\n\r\n-   Benefits of gptools\r\n    -   By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow gptools to become highly engineered shared artifacts, forming the basis of shared libraries.\r\n    -   A gptool can be used in many different contexts, and can be updated and maintained independently of the gpspecs that use it.\r\n    -   By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow non-developers to use gptools without having to understand the details of how they work.\r\n    -   At the same time, because a gptool contains a natural language prompt, it is easy for a non-developer to understand what the gptool does, and to modify it to suit their needs.\r\n\r\n## gpspec: Natural language to invoke a gptool\r\n\r\nJust as a chat enables a user to interact with an AI model, a gpspec is a natural language markdown document that defines a context in which to invoke a gptool.\r\n\r\nA gpspec is a standard markdown file, with the following additional elements:\r\n\r\n-   Links to context elements that define the context in which a particular gptool is to be invoked. The gpspec defines all possible contexts where a particular gptool might only refer to some part.\r\n-   Natural language describing the specific task to be performed as input to one or more gptools. For example, the spec for code might contain directions on the desired code as well as information about tests to be performed. Different gptools invoked from the gpspec file can be used to perform different tasks.\r\n\r\nNote that one possible use of a gpspec is to invoke a gptool, which in turn creates a new gpspec with further refinement.\r\n\r\n## gptools Extension to VS Code\r\n\r\nWe believe that human oversight of AI models is essential to their effective use.

We separate scripts into two related parts: a generic reusable _gptool_ and a natural language _gpspec_ that instantiates the gptool in a particular context\r\n\r\nKey elements of gptools:\r\n\r\n-   _gptools_ – Scripts that integrate traditional code and natural language and leverage foundation models in their execution\r\n-   _gpspecs_ – Natural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context\r\n-   _gpvm_ – A framework and runtime system that executes gpspecs and gptools\r\n-   _gptools extension to VS code_ – supporting seamless user interaction with gptools\r\n\r\n## gptool: A New Kind of Script\r\n\r\n-   A gptool is a script with the following components\r\n\r\n    -   A header that contains metadata related to the execution of the script (e.g., information about what LLM model to use, etc.)\r\n    -   A natural language prompt intended to be processed by a foundation model\r\n    -   An environment context that augments the natural language with additional data/information\r\n    -   Programming language constructs that are used to programmatically manipulate both inputs and outputs\r\n\r\n-   Benefits of gptools\r\n    -   By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow gptools to become highly engineered shared artifacts, forming the basis of shared libraries.\r\n    -   A gptool can be used in many different contexts, and can be updated and maintained independently of the gpspecs that use it.\r\n    -   By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow non-developers to use gptools without having to understand the details of how they work.\r\n    -   At the same time, because a gptool contains a natural language prompt, it is easy for a non-developer to understand what the gptool does, and to modify it to suit their needs.\r\n\r\n## gpspec: Natural language to invoke a gptool\r\n\r\nJust as a chat enables a user to interact with an AI model, a gpspec is a natural language markdown document that defines a context in which to invoke a gptool.\r\n\r\nA gpspec is a standard markdown file, with the following additional elements:\r\n\r\n-   Links to context elements that define the context in which a particular gptool is to be invoked. The gpspec defines all possible contexts where a particular gptool might only refer to some part.\r\n-   Natural language describing the specific task to be performed as input to one or more gptools. For example, the spec for code might contain directions on the desired code as well as information about tests to be performed. Different gptools invoked from the gpspec file can be used to perform different tasks.\r\n\r\nNote that one possible use of a gpspec is to invoke a gptool, which in turn creates a new gpspec with further refinement.\r\n\r\n## gptools Extension to VS Code\r\n\r\nWe believe that human oversight of AI models is essential to their effective use. To support this, we have created a VS Code extension that allows a user to interact with a gpspec and gptool in a natural way.\r\n\r\nThe extension provides the following capabilities:\r\n\r\n-   A command palette that allows a user to select a gptool to invoke in the context of a given gpspec file\r\n-   A token management system that supports connecting with the AI model of interest\r\n-   A runtime environment that:\r\n    -   Captures the context defined by the gpspec\r\n    -   Expands the gptool in the appropriate context\r\n    -   Executes whatever code is present in the gptool\r\n    -   Sends the results to the AI model\r\n    -   Processes the results on return to update the user context (which might include updating files, etc.)\r\n-   A user interface that allows the user to interact with the AI model to refine the results\r\n-   A gptool trace viewing mechanism that allows users to understand how the AI model was used to generate the results\r\n\r\n## Implications of gptools\r\n\r\nThe existence of powerful programming tools based on AI that are usable by non-developers is transformative.\r\n\r\nJust as the development of JavaScript enabled Web 2.0, and python enabled the creation of the current AI software ecosystem, gptools will fuel a new generation of AI-enhanced applications.\r\n\r\nWe envision the creation of gptools for many different verticals, with opportunities for customization and authoring at many levels of expertise:\r\n\r\n-   Professional developers and architects will define collections of gptools for a given vertical\r\n-   Professional developers can author and maintain individual gptools just as packages are authored and maintained today\r\n-   Developers and non-developers can customize gptools for their particular organization or application needs\r\n-   Non-developers can author and maintain gpspecs for their particular projects\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the existence of gptools can empower non-developers to automate their workflows in ways that were previously impossible.\r\n`````\n\nBASENAME:\n`````\ncoarch-wp.summary.md\n`````\n\nYou are an experienced technical writer and you have been given documents describing a project, including a presentation and a readme file from the project's repository, both in markdown in SOURCES.\n\nIn the file BASENAME, you will write a high level summary of the project specifically providing the following details.\n1.

We separate scripts into two related parts: a generic reusable _gptool_ and a natural language _gpspec_ that instantiates the gptool in a particular context\r\n\r\nKey elements of gptools:\r\n\r\n-   _gptools_ – Scripts that integrate traditional code and natural language and leverage foundation models in their execution\r\n-   _gpspecs_ – Natural language documents that instantiate gptools in a particular context\r\n-   _gpvm_ – A framework and runtime system that executes gpspecs and gptools\r\n-   _gptools extension to VS code_ – supporting seamless user interaction with gptools\r\n\r\n## gptool: A New Kind of Script\r\n\r\n-   A gptool is a script with the following components\r\n\r\n    -   A header that contains metadata related to the execution of the script (e.g., information about what LLM model to use, etc.)\r\n    -   A natural language prompt intended to be processed by a foundation model\r\n    -   An environment context that augments the natural language with additional data/information\r\n    -   Programming language constructs that are used to programmatically manipulate both inputs and outputs\r\n\r\n-   Benefits of gptools\r\n    -   By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow gptools to become highly engineered shared artifacts, forming the basis of shared libraries.\r\n    -   A gptool can be used in many different contexts, and can be updated and maintained independently of the gpspecs that use it.\r\n    -   By separating the gptool from the gpspec, we allow non-developers to use gptools without having to understand the details of how they work.\r\n    -   At the same time, because a gptool contains a natural language prompt, it is easy for a non-developer to understand what the gptool does, and to modify it to suit their needs.\r\n\r\n## gpspec: Natural language to invoke a gptool\r\n\r\nJust as a chat enables a user to interact with an AI model, a gpspec is a natural language markdown document that defines a context in which to invoke a gptool.\r\n\r\nA gpspec is a standard markdown file, with the following additional elements:\r\n\r\n-   Links to context elements that define the context in which a particular gptool is to be invoked. The gpspec defines all possible contexts where a particular gptool might only refer to some part.\r\n-   Natural language describing the specific task to be performed as input to one or more gptools. For example, the spec for code might contain directions on the desired code as well as information about tests to be performed. Different gptools invoked from the gpspec file can be used to perform different tasks.\r\n\r\nNote that one possible use of a gpspec is to invoke a gptool, which in turn creates a new gpspec with further refinement.\r\n\r\n## gptools Extension to VS Code\r\n\r\nWe believe that human oversight of AI models is essential to their effective use. To support this, we have created a VS Code extension that allows a user to interact with a gpspec and gptool in a natural way.\r\n\r\nThe extension provides the following capabilities:\r\n\r\n-   A command palette that allows a user to select a gptool to invoke in the context of a given gpspec file\r\n-   A token management system that supports connecting with the AI model of interest\r\n-   A runtime environment that:\r\n    -   Captures the context defined by the gpspec\r\n    -   Expands the gptool in the appropriate context\r\n    -   Executes whatever code is present in the gptool\r\n    -   Sends the results to the AI model\r\n    -   Processes the results on return to update the user context (which might include updating files, etc.)\r\n-   A user interface that allows the user to interact with the AI model to refine the results\r\n-   A gptool trace viewing mechanism that allows users to understand how the AI model was used to generate the results\r\n\r\n## Implications of gptools\r\n\r\nThe existence of powerful programming tools based on AI that are usable by non-developers is transformative.\r\n\r\nJust as the development of JavaScript enabled Web 2.0, and python enabled the creation of the current AI software ecosystem, gptools will fuel a new generation of AI-enhanced applications.\r\n\r\nWe envision the creation of gptools for many different verticals, with opportunities for customization and authoring at many levels of expertise:\r\n\r\n-   Professional developers and architects will define collections of gptools for a given vertical\r\n-   Professional developers can author and maintain individual gptools just as packages are authored and maintained today\r\n-   Developers and non-developers can customize gptools for their particular organization or application needs\r\n-   Non-developers can author and maintain gpspecs for their particular projects\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the existence of gptools can empower non-developers to automate their workflows in ways that were previously impossible.\r\n`````\n\nBASENAME:\n`````\ncoarch-wp.1pager.md\n`````\n\nYou are an experienced technical writer and you have been given documents describing a project in SOURCES.\n\nYou will create a new file called BASENAME that will be a 1 page overview of the project.  \n\nYou will focus on the most important concepts in the project in the first part of the document.\n\nIn the 2nd part of the document you will concisely answer the questions about the project posed by The Heilmeier Catechism.\n```````````````\n\n\n## Variables\nVariables are referenced through `env.NAME` in prompts.\n\n-   env.**error**: `ERROR-QVRLER`\n\n-   env.**file**\n```````````````js\n{ filename: \"coarch-wp.gpspec.md\",\nlabel: \"current\",\ncontent: \"# CoArch command file to generate CoArch whitepaper\\r\\n\\r\\n- [ba\"... }\n```````````````\n\n-   env.**links**\n```````````````js\n[ { label: \"basefile\",\n  filename: \"gptools-overview.gpspec.md\",\n  content: \"# gptools: Empowering Human Workflows with AI-Enhanced Tools\"... } ]\n```````````````\n\n-   env.**parents**\n```````````````js\n[  ]\n```````````````\n\n-   env.**fence**\n```````````````\n`````\n```````````````\n\n-   env.**promptOptions**\n```````````````js\n{  }\n```````````````\n\n-   env.**vars**\n```````````````js\n{  }\n```````````````\n\n-   env.**templates**\n```````````````js\n[ { id: \"add-comments\",\n  title: \"Add Comments\",\n  description: \"Review each chapter and adds a comment as a technical review\"... },\n{ id: \"bug-with-output-spec_2\",\n  title: \"gen to non-coarch file\",\n  description: \"Given files about a project and the goal of writing a white \"... },\n{ id: \"generate-1pager\",\n  title: \"generate 1 pager\",\n  description: \"Given markdown files describing a project, generate 1 page o\"... },\n{ id: \"generate-abstract\",\n  title: \"generate-abstract\",\n  description: \"Given files about a project and the goal of writing a white \"... },\n{ id: \"generate-introduction\",\n  title: \"generate-introduction\",\n  description: \"Given files about a project and the goal of writing a white \"... },\n{ id: \"generate-outline\",\n  title: \"generate-outline\",\n  description: \"Given markdown files describing a project, generate an outli\"... },\n{ id: \"summarize-project\",\n  title: \"summarize-project\",\n  description: \"Given markdown files describing a project, generate a summar\"... },\n{ id: \"technical\",\n  title: \"Technical proofreading\",\n  description: \"Review the text as a technical document writer.\" } ]\n```````````````\n\n-   env.**template**\n```````````````js\n{ id: \"generate-1pager\",\ntitle: \"generate 1 pager\",\ntext: \"<nothing yet>\",\njsSource: \"gptool({ title: \\\"generate 1 pager\\\", \\r\\n         description: \"...,\nfilename: \"c:\\\\projects\\\\coarch\\\\packages\\\\whitepaper\\\\prompts\\\\generate-1pag\"...,\ndescription: \"Given markdown files describing a project, generate 1 page o\"...,\nmaxTokens: 4000,\nmodel: \"gpt-4-32k\",\ncategories: [ \"whitepaper\" ],\ninput: \".md\" }\n```````````````\n\n## System prompt\n###  template: `system`\n\n```````````````js\n  1: system({ title: \"System prompt\" })\n  2: $`You are concise.

By separating gptools and gpspecs, we enable modularity, reuse, and independent maintenance.\n\n4. **Who cares?** Developers, non-developers, and organizations that want to leverage AI-enhanced tools to improve their workflows and automate tasks that were previously impossible.\n\n5. **If you are successful, what difference will it make?** It will transform the way AI-enhanced applications are developed and used, enabling non-developers to automate their workflows and fostering a new generation of AI-enhanced applications.\n\n6. **What are the risks and payoffs?** Risks include potential mistakes made by AI models and the challenge of understanding their decision-making process. The payoff is the democratization of AI-enhanced tools, enabling a wider range of users to benefit from their capabilities.\n\n7. **How much will it cost?** The cost will depend on the development and maintenance of the gptools framework, runtime system, and VS code extension. It will also depend on the AI models used and the resources required for their execution.\n\n8. **How long will it take?** The timeline will depend on the complexity of the gptools, gpspecs, and the integration with foundation models. It will also depend on the adoption and customization of gptools by various users and organizations.\n\n9. **What are the midterm and final \"exams\" to check for success?** Midterm exams include the successful development and integration of gptools, gpspecs, and the VS code extension. Final exams involve widespread adoption, customization, and the creation of AI-enhanced applications across various verticals.\n`````"}}}
