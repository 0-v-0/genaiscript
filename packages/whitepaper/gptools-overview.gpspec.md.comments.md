2. Clarify the sentence about the separation of gptool and gpspec

```

4. Improve clarity in the sentence about invoking a gptool to create a new gpspec
```diff
- Note that one use of a gpspec would be to invoke a gptool to create a new gpspec with further refinement.
+ Note that one possible use of a gpspec is to invoke a gptool, which in turn creates a new gpspec with further refinement.
```

5. Add a comma for better readability
```diff
