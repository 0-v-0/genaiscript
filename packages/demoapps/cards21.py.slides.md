### Slide 8: Main Function

    player = Player(100)
    dealer = Dealer()
    deck = Deck()
    game = Game(player, dealer, deck)
    game.start()
    player.money += game.handle_round()
    game.end()
```
        self.hand = Hand()

    def receive_card(self, card):
        self.hand.add_card(card)

    def should_draw(self):

```

        self.dealer = dealer
        self.deck = deck
        self.bet = 0

    def start(self):

        for _ in range(2):
            self.player
