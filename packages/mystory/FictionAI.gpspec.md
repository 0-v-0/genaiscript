## Genre Near-future hard science fiction short story 
Write the story so that it is a page turner and the reader is left wanting more.  

## Setting Boulder, CO.  

## Characters 
The story involves a family with a father and daughter who is a recently graduated high school student.  

## Context and background
It takes place the summer before she goes off to college.
Her father is scientist who works at NCAR.  The father and daughter don't get along too well because she wants to leave Boulder and he wants her to stay.
She has computing skills and likes to experiment with generative AI.  She discovers something incredible which leads to a series of events that change her life forever.

## Stylistic goals
- I want the story to be fun, quirky and interesting in the way the Neal Stephenson's books are. 
- It should reference cutting edge technology and contain factual understanding of computers, AI, recent technical advances and plausible speculation about future advances.
- The story should have some twists and elements where unexpected details are revealed or unexpected events occur.

## Theme goals
I want the reader to develop an emotional attachment to the main character.
I want the story to explore the relationship between the father and daughter and evoke an emotional response from the reader.
I want the story to explore real issues that are relevant to the reader's life and focus on the risks of technology and the impact that technology has on society.

## Scope and length
- The plot elements of the story have to fit into that constraint and consist of a series of at most 10 scenes, each appearing in a different chapter.
- The total length of the story should be about 10,000 words.

## Conclusion
End the story with happy-for-now ending but leave the door open for a sequel.
